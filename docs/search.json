    "text": "Preface\nData science is a field in which we become aware of the fascinating overlap between machine learning and statistics. Many data science students usually come across everyday machine learning and statistics concepts or ideas that might only differ in names. For instance, simple terms such as weights in supervised learning (and their statistical counterpart as regression coefficients) might be misleading for students starting their data science formation. On the other hand, from an instructor’s perspective in a data science program that subsets its courses in machine learning in Python and statistics in R, regression courses in R also demand the inclusion of Python-related packages as alternative tools. Furthermore, in a graduate program such as the Master of Data Science (MDS) at the University of British Columbia, this is especially critical for students whose career plan leans towards the industry job market where Python is more heavily used.\nThat said, we can state that data science is a substantial synergy between machine learning and statistics. Nevertheless, many gaps between both disciplines still need to be addressed. Thus, closing these critical gaps is imperative in a domain with accelerated growth, such as data science. In this regard, the MDS Stat-ML dictionary has inspired us to write this textbook. It basically consists of common ground between foundational supervised learning models from machine learning and regression models commonly used in statistics. We strive to explore linear modelling approaches as a primary step while highlighting different terminology found in both fields. Furthermore, this discussion is more comprehensive than a simple conceptual exploration. Hence, the second step is hands-on practice via the corresponding Python packages for machine learning and R for statistics.",

Also, some coding background on R (R Core Team 2024) and/or Python (Van Rossum and Drake 2009) is recommended. That said, the following topics are suggested as fundamental reviews:\n\nMutivariable differential calculus and linear algebra. Certain sections of each chapter pertain to modelling estimation. Therefore, topics such as partial derivatives and matrix algebra are a great asset. You can find helpful learning resources on the MDS webpage.\nBasic Python programming.

The MDS course DSCI 552 (Statistical Inference and Computation I) is an ideal example of a quick review.\nFoundations of supervised learning. The second data science paradigm to be covered pertains to prediction, which is core in machine learning.

    "text": "1.1 The ML-Stats Dictionary\nMachine learning and statistics usually overlap across many subjects, and regression modelling is no exception. Topics we teach in an utterly regression-based course, under a purely statistical framework, also appear in machine learning-based courses such as fundamental supervised learning, but often with different terminology. On this basis, the Master of Data Science (MDS) program at the University of British Columbia (UBC) provides the MDS Stat-ML dictionary (Gelbart 2017) under the following premises:\nIndeed, both disciplines have a tremendous amount of jargon and terminology. Furthermore, as previously emphasized in the Preface, machine learning and statistics construct a substantial synergy reflected in data science. Even with this, people in both fields could encounter miscommunication issues when working together. This should not happen if we build solid bridges between both disciplines. Therefore, the above admonition in Important 1.1 for a definition will pave the way to a complimentary resource called the ML-Stats dictionary (ML stands for Machine Learning). This comprehensive ML-Stats dictionary is imperative, and our textbook offers a perfect opportunity to build this resource. Primarily, this dictionary will clarify any potential confusion between statistics and machine learning regarding terminology within supervised learning and regression analysis contexts.\nFinally, Appendix A will be the section in this book where the reader can find all those statistical and machine learning-related terms in alphabetical order. Notable terms (either statistical or machine learning-related) will include an admonition identifying which terms (again, either statistical or machine learning-related) are equivalent (or NOT equivalent if that is the case). Take as an example the statistical term dependent variable:\nThen, the above definition will be followed by this admonition:\nAbove, we have identified four equivalent terms for the term dependent variable. Furthermore, according to our already defined colour scheme, these terms can be statistical or machine learning-related. Finally, note we will start using this colour scheme in Chapter 2.\nNow, let us proceed to explaining the three pillars on which this textbook is built upon: a data science workflow, the right workflow flavour (inferential or predictive), and a regression toolbox.",

    "section": "\n1.2 The Data Science Workflow",
    "text": "1.2 The Data Science Workflow\nUnderstanding the data science workflow is essential for mastering regression analysis. This workflow serves as a blueprint that guides us through each stage of our analysis, ensuring that we apply a systematic approach to solving our inquiries in a reproducible way. Each of the three pillars of this textbook—data science workflow, the right workflow flavor (inferential or predictive), and a regression toolbox—are deeply interconnected. Regardless of the regression model we explore, this general workflow provides a consistent framework that helps us navigate our data analysis with clarity and purpose. As shown in Figure 1.1, the data science workflow is composed of the following stages (each of which will be discussed in more detail in subsequent subsections):\n\n\nStudy design: Define the research question, objectives, and variables of interest to ensure the analysis is purpose-driven and aligned with the problem at hand.\n\nData collection and wrangling: Gather and clean data, addressing issues such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to transform it into a usable format.\n\nExploratory data analysis: Explore the data through statistical summaries and visualizations to identify patterns, trends, and potential anomalies.\n\nData modelling: Apply statistical or machine learning models to uncover relationships between variables or make predictions based on the data.\n\nEstimation: Calculate model parameters to quantify relationships between variables and assess the accuracy and reliability of the model.\n\nGoodness of fit: Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics and diagnostic checks to determine how well it explains the data.\n\nResults: Interpret the model’s outputs to derive meaningful insights and provide answers to the original research question.\n\nStorytelling Communicate the findings through a clear, engaging narrative that is accessible to a non-technical audience.\n\nBy adhering to this workflow, we ensure that our regression analyses are not only systematic and thorough but also capable of producing results that are meaningful within the context of the problem we aim to solve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Importance of a Formal Structure in Regression Analysis\n\n\n\nFrom the earliest stages of learning data analysis, understanding the importance of a structured workflow is crucial. If we do not adhere to a predefined workflow, we risk misinterpreting the data, leading to incorrect conclusions that fail to address the core questions of our analysis. Such missteps can result in outcomes that are not only meaningless but potentially misleading when taken out of the problem’s context. Therefore, it is essential for aspiring data scientists to internalize this workflow from the very beginning of their education. A systematic approach ensures that each stage of the analysis is conducted with precision, ultimately producing reliable and contextually relevant results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Data science workflow for inferential and predictive inquiries in regression analysis and supervised learning, respectively.\n\n\n\n1.2.1 Study Design\nThe first stage of this workflow is centered around defining the main statistical inquiries we aim to address throughout the data analysis process. As a data scientist, your primary task is to translate these inquiries from the stakeholders into one of two categories: inferential or predictive. This classification determines the direction of your analysis and the methods you will use.\n\nInferential: The objective here is to explore and quantify relationships of association or causation between explanatory variables (regressors) and the response variable within the context of the problem at hand. For example, you may seek to determine whether a specific marketing campaign (regressor) significantly impacts sales revenue (response) and, if so, by how much.\nPredictive: In this case, the focus is on making accurate predictions about the response variable based on future observations of the regressors. Unlike inferential inquiries, where understanding the relationship between variables is key, the primary goal here is to maximize prediction accuracy. This approach is fundamental in machine learning. For instance, you might build a model to predict future sales revenue based on past marketing expenditures, without necessarily needing to understand the underlying relationship between the two.\n\nExample: Predicting Housing Prices\nTo illustrate the study design stage, let’s consider a simple example: predicting housing prices in a specific city.\n\nIf our goal is inferential, we might be interested in understanding the relationship between various factors (like square footage, number of bedrooms, and proximity to schools) and housing prices. Specifically, we would ask questions like, “How much does the number of bedrooms affect the price of a house, after accounting for other factors?”\nIf our goal is predictive, we would focus on creating a model that can accurately predict the price of a house based on its features, regardless of whether we fully understand how each factor contributes to the price.\n\nIn both cases, the study design stage involves clearly defining these objectives and determining the appropriate methods to address them. This stage sets the foundation for all subsequent steps in the data science workflow, as illustrated in Figure 1.2. Once the study design is established, the next stage is data collection and wrangling.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Study design stage from the data science workflow in Figure 1.1. This stage is directly followed by data collection and wrangling.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Data Collection and Wrangling\nOnce we have clearly defined our statistical questions, the next crucial step is to collect the data that will form the basis of our analysis. The way we collect this data is vital because it directly affects the accuracy and reliability of our results:\n\n\nFor inferential inquiries, we focus on understanding large groups or systems (populations) that we cannot fully observe. These populations are governed by characteristics (parameters) that we want to estimate. Because we can’t study every individual in the population, we collect a smaller, representative subset called a sample. The method we use to collect this sample—known as sampling—is crucial. A proper sampling method ensures that our sample reflects the larger population, allowing us to make accurate generalizations (inferences) about the entire group. After collecting the sample, it’s common practice to randomly split the data into training and test sets. This split allows us to build and validate our models, ensuring that the findings are robust and not overly tailored to the specific data at hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip 1.2: A Quick Debrief on Sampling!\n\n\n\nAlthough this book does not cover sampling methods in detail, it’s important to know that the way you collect your sample can greatly influence your results. Depending on the problem, you might use different techniques:\n\n\nSimple Random Sampling: Every individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nSystematic Sampling: You select individuals at regular intervals from a list of the population.\n\nStratified Sampling: You divide the population into subgroups (strata) and take a proportional sample from each subgroup.\n\nClustered Sampling: You divide the population into clusters and randomly select whole clusters for your sample.\nEtc.\n\nAs in the case of Regression Analysis, statistical sampling is a vast field, and we could spend a whole course on it. If you’re interested in learning more about these methods, Sampling: design and analysis by Lohr is a great resource.\n\n\n\n\nFor predictive inquiries, our goal is often to use existing data to make predictions about future events or outcomes. In these cases, we usually work with large datasets (databases) that have already been collected. Instead of focusing on whether the data represents a population (as in inferential inquiries), we focus on cleaning and preparing the data so that it can be used to train models that make accurate predictions. After wrangling the data, it is typically split into training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to build the model, the validation set is used to tune model parameters, and the test set evaluates the model’s final performance on unseen data.\n\nExample: Collecting Data for Housing Price Predictions\nLet’s continue with our housing price prediction example to illustrate these concepts:\n\nInferential Approach: Suppose we want to understand how the number of bedrooms affects housing prices in a city. To do this, we would collect a sample of house sales that accurately represents the city’s entire housing market. For instance, we might use stratified sampling to ensure that we include houses from different neighborhoods in proportion to how common they are. After collecting the data, we would split it into training and test sets. The training set helps us build our model and estimate the relationship between variables, while the test set allows us to evaluate how well our findings generalize to new data.\nPredictive Approach: If our goal is to predict the selling price of a house based on its features (like size, number of bedrooms, and location), we would gather a large dataset of recent house sales. This data might come from a real estate database that tracks the details of each sale. Before we can use this data to train a model, we would clean it by filling in any missing information, converting data to a consistent format, and making sure all variables are ready for analysis. After preprocessing, we would split the data into training, validation, and test sets. The training set would be used to fit the model, the validation set to fine-tune it, and the test set to assess how well the model can predict prices for houses it hasn’t seen before.\n\nAs shown in Figure 1.3, the data collection and wrangling stage is fundamental to the workflow. It directly follows the study design and sets the stage for exploratory data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Data collection and wrangling stage from the data science workflow in Figure 1.1. This stage is directly followed by exploratory data analysis and preceded by study design.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Exploratory Data Analysis\nBefore diving into data modeling, it’s crucial to develop a deep understanding of the relationships between the variables in your training data. This is where the third stage of the data science workflow—Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)—comes into play. EDA serves as a vital process that allows you to visualize and summarize your data, uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and test key assumptions that will inform your modeling decisions.\nThe first step in EDA is to classify your variables according to their types. This classification is essential because it guides your choice of analysis techniques and models. Specifically, you need to determine whether each variable is discrete or continuous, and whether it has any specific characteristics such as being bounded or unbounded.\n\n\nResponse Variable:\n\nDetermine if your response variable is discrete (e.g., binary, count-based, categorical) or continuous.\nIf it is continuous, consider whether it is bounded (e.g., percentages that range between 0 and 100) or unbounded (e.g., a variable like temperature that can take on a wide range of values).\n\n\n\nRegressors:\n\nFor each regressor, identify whether it is discrete or continuous.\nIf a regressor is discrete, classify it further as binary, count-based, or categorical.\nIf a regressor is continuous, determine whether it is bounded or unbounded.\n\n\n\nThis classification step ensures that you are prepared to choose the correct visualization and statistical methods for your analysis, as different types of variables often require different approaches.\nThis classification step ensures that you are prepared to choose the correct visualization and statistical methods for your analysis, as different types of variables often require different approaches.\nAfter classifying your variables, the next step is to create visualizations and calculate descriptive statistics using your training data. This involves coding plots that can reveal the underlying distribution of each variable and the relationships between them. For instance, you might create histograms to visualize distributions, scatter plots to explore relationships between continuous variables, and box plots to compare categorical variables against the response variable.\nAlongside these visualizations, it is important to calculate key descriptive statistics such as the mean, median, and standard deviation. These statistics provide a numerical summary of your data, offering insights into central tendency and variability. You might also use a correlation matrix to assess the strength of relationships between continuous variables.\nOnce you have generated these plots and statistics, they should be displayed in a clear and logical manner. The goal here is to interpret the data and draw preliminary conclusions about the relationships between variables. Presenting these findings effectively helps to uncover key insights and prepares you for the modeling stage.\nFinally, the insights gained from this exploratory analysis must be clearly articulated. This involves summarizing the key findings and considering their implications for the next stage of the workflow—data modeling. Observing patterns, correlations, and potential outliers in this stage will inform your modeling approach and ensure that it is grounded in a thorough and informed analysis.\nThis structured approach to EDA is visually summarized in Figure 1.4, illustrating the sequential steps from variable classification to the delivery of exploratory insights.\nExample: EDA for Housing Price Predictions\nTo illustrate the EDA process, let’s apply it to the example of predicting housing prices.\nWe start with variable classification:\n\nThe response variable is the sale price of a house, a continuous and unbounded variable.\nThe regressors include:\n\n\nNumber of bedrooms: Discrete, count-based.\n\nSquare footage: Continuous and unbounded.\n\nNeighborhood type: Discrete, categorical (e.g., urban, suburban, rural).\n\nProximity to schools: Continuous, potentially bounded by distance.\n\n\n\nOnce the variables are classified, we move on to coding plots and calculating descriptive statistics. Here are a couple of visualizations that can be helpful in this context:\n\nA histogram of sale prices helps visualize the distribution and spot any outliers.\nA scatter plot of square footage versus sale price shows the relationship, typically revealing a positive correlation.\n\nBox plots compare sale prices across different neighborhood types, highlighting any variations in median prices.\n\nDescriptive statistics like the mean and standard deviation provide a numerical summary, while a correlation matrix helps assess relationships between continuous variables like square footage and sale price.\n\nFinally, in displaying and interpreting results, these plots and statistics guide us in understanding the data:\n\nThe histogram might show most houses fall within a mid-range price.\nThe scatter plot could confirm that larger houses generally sell for more.\nBox plots may reveal that urban homes tend to have higher prices.\n\nThese exploratory insights help identify key predictors like square footage and neighborhood type, and highlight any outliers that may require further attention during modeling.\nBy following these steps, the EDA process in the housing price prediction example lays a solid foundation for effective modeling, ensuring that the key variables and their relationships are well understood.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Exploratory data analysis stage from the data science workflow in Figure 1.1.

This stage is directly preceded by exploratory data analysis. On the other hand, it is directly followed by estimation but indirectly with goodness of fit.

    "text": "1.3 Mindmap of Regression Analysis\nHaving defined the necessary statistical aspects to execute a proper supervised learning analysis, either inferential or predictive across its seven sequential phases, we must dig into the different approaches we might encounter in practice as regression models. The nature of our outcome of interest will dictate any given modelling approach to apply, depicted as clouds in Figure 1.10. Note these regression models can be split into two sets depending on whether the outcome of interest is continuous or discrete. Therefore, under a probabilistic view, identifying the nature of a given random variable is crucial in regression analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.10: Regression analysis mindmap depicting all modelling techniques to be explored in this book. These techniques are split into two big sets: continuous and discrete outcomes.\n\n\nThat said, we will go beyond OLS regression and explore further regression techniques. In practice, these techniques have been developed in the statistical literature to address practical cases where the OLS modelling framework and assumptions are not suitable anymore. Thus, throughout this block, we will cover (at least) one new regression model per lecture.\nAs we can see in the clouds of Figure 1.10, there are 13 regression models: 8 belonging to discrete outcomes and 5 to continuous outcomes. Each of these models is contained in a chapter of this book, beginning with the most basic regression tool known as ordinary least-squares in Chapter 3. We must clarify that the current statistical literature is not restricted to these 13 regression models. The field of regression analysis is vast, and one might encounter more complex models to target certain specific inquiries. Nonetheless, I consider these models the fundamental regression approaches that any data scientist must be familiar with in everyday practice.\nEven though this book comprises 13 chapters, each depicting a different regression model, we have split these chapters into two major subsets: those with continuous outcomes and those with discrete outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nGelbart, Michael. 2017. “Data Science Terminology.” UBC MDS.

    "text": "2.1 Basics of Probability\nIn terms of regression analysis and its supervised learning counterpart (either on an inferential or predictive framework), probability can be viewed as the solid foundation on which more complex tools, including estimation and hypothesis testing, are built upon. Under this foundation, our data is coming from a given population or system of interest. Moreover, the population or system is assumed to be governed by parameters which, as data scientists or researchers, they are of their best interest to study. That said, the terms population and parameter will pave the way to our first statistical definitions.\nThe parameter definition in Important 2.2 points out a crucial fact in investigating any given population or system:\nGiven this fact, it would be pretty unfortunate and inconvenient if we eventually wanted to discover any significant insights about the population or system. Therefore, let us proceed to our so-called tasty example so we can dive into the need for statistical inference and why probability is our perfect ally in this parameter quest.\nImagine you are the owner of a large fleet of ice cream carts, around 900 to be exact. These ice cream carts operate across different parks in the following Canadian cities: Vancouver, Victoria, Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Toronto, and Montréal. In the past, to optimize operational costs, you decided to limit ice cream cones to only two items: vanilla and chocolate flavours, as in Figure 2.1.\nNow, let us direct this whole case onto a more statistical and probabilistic field; suppose you have a well-defined overall population of interest for those above eight Canadian cities: children between 4 and 11 years old attending these parks during the Summer weekends. Of course, Summer time is coming this year, and you would like to know which ice cream cone flavour is the favourite one for this population (and by how much!). As a business owner, investigating ice cream flavour preferences would allow you to plan Summer restocks more carefully with your corresponding suppliers. Therefore, it would be essential to start collecting consumer data so the company can tackle this demand query.\nAlso, suppose there is a second query. For the sake of our case, we will call it a time query. As a critical component of demand planning, besides estimating which cone flavour is the most preferred one (and by how much!) for the above population of interest, the operations area is currently requiring a realistic estimation of the average waiting time from one customer to the next one in any given cart during Summer weekends. This average waiting time would allow the operations team to plan carefully how much stock each cart should have so there will not be any waste or shortage.\nNote that the nature of the aforementioned time query is more related to a larger population. Therefore, we can define it as all our ice cream customers during the Summer weekends. Furthermore, this second definition would limit this query to our corresponding general ice cream customers, given the requirements of our operations team, and not all the children between 4 and 11 years old attending the parks during Summer weekends. Consequently, it is crucial to note that the nature of our queries will dictate how we define our population and our subsequent data modelling and statistical inference.\nSummer time represents the most profitable season from a business perspective, thus solving these above two queries is a significant priority for your company. Hence, you decide to organize a meeting with your eight general managers (one per Canadian city). Finally, during the meeting with the general managers, it was decided to do the following:\nSurprisingly, when discussing study requirements for the marketing firm who would be in charge of it for the demand query, Vancouver’s general manager dares to state the following:\nOn the other hand, when agreeing on the specific operations protocol to start recording waiting times for all the 900 vending carts this upcoming Summer, Ottawa’s general manager provides a comment for further statistical food for thought:\nBingo! Ottawa’s general manager just nailed the probabilistic way of making inference on our population parameter of interest for the time query. Indeed, their comment was primarily framed from a business perspective of optimizing operational costs. Still, this fact does not take away a crucial insight on which statistical inference is built: a random sample (as in Important 2.7). As for Vancouver’s general manager, ironically, their statement is NOT PRECISE at all! Mimicking a census-type study might not be the most optimal decision for the demand query given the time constraint and the potential size of its target population.\nWe can state that probability is viewed as the language to decode random phenomena that occur in any given population or system of interest. In our example, we have two random phenomena:\nHence, let us finally define what we mean by probability along with the inherent concept of sample space.\nNote the definition of the probability for an event \\(A\\) in Important 2.3 specifically highlights the following:\nThe “infinity” term is key when it comes to an understanding the philosophy behind the frequentist school of statistical thinking in contrast to its Bayesian counterpart. In general, the frequentist way of practicing statistics in terms of probability and inference is the approach we usually learn in introductory courses, more specifically when it comes to hypothesis testing and confidence intervals which will be explored in Section 2.3. That said, the Bayesian approach is another way of practicing statistical inference. Its philosophy differs in what information is used to infer our population parameters of interest. Below, we briefly define both schools of thinking.\nLet us put the definitions for both schools from Important 2.5 and Important 2.6 into a more concrete example. We can use the demand query from our ice cream case as a starting point. More concretely, we can dig more into a standalone population parameter such as the probability that a randomly selected child between 4 and 11 years old, attending the parks of the above eight Canadian cities during the Summer weekends, prefers the chocolate-flavoured ice cream cone over the vanilla one. Think about the following two hypothetical questions:\nEquation 2.3\n\\[\nP(X = x \\mid \\pi) = \\pi^x (1 - \\pi)^{1 - x} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad x = 0, 1.\n\\tag{2.3}\\]",

    "text": "Important 2.1: Definition of population\n\n\n\nIt is a whole collection of individuals or items that share distinctive attributes. As data scientists or researchers, we are interested in studying these attributes, which we assume are governed by parameters. In practice, we must be as precise as possible when defining our given population such that we would frame our entire data modelling process since its very early stages. Examples of a population could be the following:\n\nChildren between the ages of 5 and 10 years old in states of the American West Coast.\nCustomers of musical vinyl records in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta.\nAvocado trees grown in the Mexican state of Michoacán.\nAdult giant pandas in the Southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan.\nMature açaí palm trees from the Brazilian Amazonian jungle.\n\n\n\nImage by Eak K. via Pixabay.\n\nNote that the term population could be exchanged for the term system, given that certain contexts do not particularly refer to individuals or items. Instead, these contexts could refer to processes whose attributes are also governed by parameters. Examples of a system could be the following:\n\nThe production of cellular phones from a given model in a set of manufacturing facilities.\nThe sale process in the Vancouver franchises of a well-known ice cream parlour.\nThe transit cycle during rush hours on weekdays in the twelve lines of Mexico City’s subway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant 2.2: Definition of parameter\n\n\n\nIt is a characteristic (numerical or even non-numerical, such as a distinctive category) that summarizes the state of our population or system of interest. Examples of a population parameter can be described as follows:\n\nThe average weight of children between the ages of 5 and 10 years old in states of the American west coast (numerical).\nThe variability in the height of the mature açaí palm trees from the Brazilian Amazonian jungle (numerical).\nThe proportion of defective items in the production of cellular phones in a set of manufacturing facilities (numerical).\nThe average customer waiting time to get their order in the Vancouver franchises of a well-known ice cream parlour (numerical).\nThe most favourite pizza topping of vegetarian adults between the ages of 30 and 40 years old in Edmonton (non-numerical).\n\n\n\nImage by meineresterampe via Pixabay.\n\nNote the standard mathematical notation for population parameters are Greek letters. Moreover, in practice, these population parameter(s) of interest will be unknown to the data scientist or researcher. Instead, they would use formal statistical inference to estimate them.\n\n\n\n\nOur parameter(s) of interest are usually unknown!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The two flavours of the ice cream cone you sell across all your ice cream carts: vanilla and chocolate. Image by tomekwalecki via Pixabay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage by Icons8 Team via Unsplash.\n\n\n\n\nFor the demand query, a comprehensive market study will be run on the population of interest across the eight Canadian cities right before next Summer; suppose we are currently in Spring.\nFor the time query, since the operations team has not previously recorded any historical data, ALL vendor staff from 900 carts will start collecting data on the waiting time in seconds between each customer this upcoming Summer.\n\n\n\nSince we’re already planning to collect consumer data on these cities, let’s mimic a census-type study to ensure we can have the MOST PRECISE results on their preferences.\n\n\n\nThe operations protocol for recording waiting times in the 900 vending carts looks too cumbersome to implement straightforwardly this upcoming Summer. Why don’t we select A SMALLER GROUP of ice cream carts across the eight cities to have a more efficient process implementation that would allow us to optimize operational costs?\n\n\n\nRealistically, there is no cheap and efficient way to conduct a census-type study for any of the two queries!\n\n\n\nFor the demand query, a phenomenon can be represented by the preferred ice cream cone flavour of any randomly selected child between 4 and 11 years old attending the parks of the above eight Canadian cities during the Summer weekends.\nRegarding the time query, a phenomenon of this kind can be represented by any randomly recorded waiting time between two customers during a Summer weekend in any of the above eight Canadian cities.\n\n\n\n\nMexican lotería, a bingo-type game. Image by irvin Macfarland via Unsplash.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant 2.3: Definition of probability\n\n\n\nLet \\(A\\) be an event of interest in a random phenomenon, in a population or system of interest, whose all possible outcomes belong to a given sample space \\(S\\). Generally, the probability for this event \\(A\\) happening can be mathematically depicted as \\(P(A)\\). Moreover, suppose we observe the random phenomenon \\(n\\) times such as we were running some class of experiment, then \\(P(A)\\) is defined as the following ratio:\n\\[\nP(A) = \\frac{\\text{Number of times event $A$ is observed}}{n},\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\nas the \\(n\\) times we observe the random phenomenon goes to infinity.\nEquation 2.1 will always put \\(P(A)\\) in the following numerical range:\n\\[\n0 \\leq P(A) \\leq 1.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant 2.4: Definition of sample space\n\n\n\nLet \\(A\\) be an event of interest in a random phenomenon in a population or system of interest. The sample space \\(S\\) of event \\(A\\) denotes the set of all the possible random outcomes we might encounter every time we randomly observe \\(A\\) such as we were running some class of experiment.\nNote each of these outcomes has a determined probability associated with them. If we add up all these probabilities, the probability of the sample \\(S\\) will be one, i.e.,\n\\[\nP(S) = 1.\n\\tag{2.2}\\]\n\n\n\n\n… as the \\(n\\) times we observe the random phenomenon goes to infinity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant 2.5: Definition of frequentist statistics\n\n\n\nThis statistical school of thinking heavily relies on the frequency of events to estimate specific parameters of interest in a population or system. This frequency of events is reflected in the repetition of \\(n\\) experiments involving a random phenomenon within this population or system.\nUnder the umbrella of this approach, we assume that our governing parameters are fixed. Note that, within the philosophy of this school of thinking, we can only make precise and accurate predictions as long as we repeat our \\(n\\) experiments as many times as possible, i.e.,\n\\[\nn \\rightarrow \\infty.\n\\]\n\n\nImage by Mari Carmen Díaz via Pixabay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant 2.6: Definition of Bayesian statistics\n\n\n\nThis statistical school of thinking also relies on the frequency of events to estimate specific parameters of interest in a population or system. Nevertheless, unlike frequentist statistics, Bayesian statisticians use prior knowledge on the population parameters to update their estimations on them along with the current evidence they can gather. This evidence is in the form of the repetition of \\(n\\) experiments involving a random phenomenon. All these ingredients allow Bayesian statisticians to make inference by conducting appropriate hypothesis testings, which are designed differently from their mainstream frequentist counterpart.\n\n\nThe unique known portrait of Reverend Thomas Bayes according to O’Donnell, T. (1936), even though Bellhouse (2004) argues it might not be a Bayes’ portrait.\n\nUnder the umbrella of this approach, we assume that our governing parameters are random; i.e., they have their own sample space and probabilities associated to their corresponding outcomes. The statistical process of inference is heavily backed up by probability theory mostly in the form of the Bayes theorem (named after Reverend Thomas Bayes, an English statistician from the 18th century). This theorem uses our current evidence along with our prior beliefs to deliver a posterior distribution of our random parameter(s) of interest.\n\n\n\n\nFrom a frequentist point of view, what is the estimated probability of preferring chocolate over vanilla after randomly surveying \\(n = 100\\) children from our population of interest?\nUsing a Bayesian approach, suppose the marketing team has found ten prior market studies on similar children populations on their preferred ice cream flavour (between chocolate and vanilla). Therefore, along with our actual random survey of \\(n = 100\\) children from our population of interest, what is the posterior estimation of the probability of preferring chocolate over vanilla?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 2.2: Heads-up on the difference between frequentist and Bayesian statistics!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant 2.7: Definition of random sample",

With practice over time, you would likely end up memorizing most of this alphabet.\n\n\nTable B.1: Greek alphabet composed of 24 letters, from left to right you can find the name of letter along with its corresponding uppercase and lowercase forms.\n\n\n\nName\nUppercase\nLowercase\n\n\n\nAlpha\n\\(\\text{A}\\)\n\\(\\alpha\\)\n\n\nBeta\n\\(\\text{B}\\)\n\\(\\beta\\)\n\n\nGamma\n\\(\\Gamma\\)\n\\(\\gamma\\)\n\n\nDelta\n\\(\\Delta\\)\n\\(\\delta\\)\n\n\nEpsilon\n\\(\\text{E}\\)\n\\(\\epsilon\\)\n\n\nZeta\n\\(\\text{Z}\\)\n\\(\\zeta\\)\n\n\nEta\n\\(\\text{H}\\)\n\\(\\eta\\)\n\n\nTheta\n\\(\\Theta\\)\n\\(\\theta\\)\n\n\nIota\n\\(\\text{I}\\)\n\\(\\iota\\)\n\n\nKappa\n\\(\\text{K}\\)\n\\(\\kappa\\)\n\n\nLambda\n\\(\\Lambda\\)\n\\(\\lambda\\)\n\n\nMu\n\\(\\text{M}\\)\n\\(\\mu\\)\n\n\nNu\n\\(\\text{N}\\)\n\\(\\nu\\)\n\n\nXi\n\\(\\Xi\\)\n\\(\\xi\\)\n\n\nO\n\\(\\text{O}\\)\n\\(\\text{o}\\)\n\n\nPi\n\\(\\Pi\\)\n\\(\\pi\\)\n\n\nRho\n\\(\\text{P}\\)\n\\(\\rho\\)\n\n\nSigma\n\\(\\Sigma\\)\n\\(\\sigma\\)\n\n\nTau\n\\(\\text{T}\\)\n\\(\\tau\\)\n\n\nUpsilon\n\\(\\Upsilon\\)\n\\(\\upsilon\\)\n\n\nPhi\n\\(\\Phi\\)\n\\(\\phi\\)\n\n\nChi\n\\(\\text{X}\\)\n\\(\\chi\\)\n\n\nPsi\n\\(\\Psi\\)\n\\(\\psi\\)\n\n\nOmega\n\\(\\Omega\\)\n\\(\\omega\\)",
