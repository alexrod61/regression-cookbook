# Preface {.unnumbered}

> **Let the regression cooking begin!**


Throughout my journey as a postdoctoral fellow in the [Master of Data Science (MDS)](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia, I became aware of the fascinating overlap between **Machine Learning** and **Statistics**. Many **Data Science** students usually come across common Machine Learning/Statistics concepts or ideas that might only differ in names. For instance, simple terms such as weights in **supervised learning** (and their equivalent statistical counterpart as regression coefficients) might be misleading for students starting their Data Science formation. On the other hand, from an instructor's perspective in a Data Science program that subsets its courses in Machine Learning in `Python` and Statistics in `R`, regression courses in `R` also demand the inclusion of `Python`-related packages as alternative tools. In my MDS teaching experience, this is especially critical for students whose career plans lean towards industry where `Python` is more heavily used.

As a Data Science educator, I view this field as a substantial **synergy** between Machine Learning and Statistics. Nevertheless, many gaps between both disciplines still need to be addressed. Thus, closing these critical gaps is imperative in a domain with accelerated growth, such as Data Science. In this regard, the [MDS Stat-ML dictionary](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/terminology/) inspired me to write this textbook. It basically consists of **common ground** between **foundational supervised learning models** from Machine Learning and **regression models** commonly used in Statistics. I strive to explore **linear modelling approaches** as a primary step while highlighting different terminology found in both fields. Furthermore, this discussion is more comprehensive than a simple conceptual exploration. Hence, the second step is **hands-on practice** via the corresponding `Python` packages for Machine Learning and `R` for Statistics.

## Fun Fact!

While thinking about possible names for this work, I was planning to name it "*Machine Learning and Statistics: A Common Ground.*" Nevertheless, it was quite plain and boring! That said, this whole textbook idea sounded analogous to a cookbook, given its heavily applied focus.

**Hence, the cookbook name idea**!
