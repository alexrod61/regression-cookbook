# Preface {.unnumbered}

> **Let the regression cooking begin!**

Data science is a field in which we become aware of the fascinating overlap between **machine learning** and **statistics**. Many data science students usually come across everyday machine learning and statistics concepts or ideas that might only differ in names. For instance, simple terms such as weights in **supervised learning** (and their statistical counterpart as regression coefficients) might be misleading for students starting their data science formation. On the other hand, from an instructor's perspective in a data science program that subsets its courses in machine learning in `Python` and statistics in `R`, regression courses in `R` also demand the inclusion of `Python`-related packages as alternative tools. Furthermore, in a graduate program such as the [Master of Data Science (MDS)](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia, this is especially critical for students whose career plan leans towards the industry job market where `Python` is more heavily used.

That said, we can state that data science is a **substantial synergy** between machine learning and statistics. Nevertheless, many gaps between both disciplines still need to be addressed. Thus, closing these critical gaps is imperative in a domain with accelerated growth, such as data science. In this regard, the [MDS Stat-ML dictionary](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/terminology/) has inspired us to write this textbook. It basically consists of **common ground** between **foundational supervised learning models** from machine learning and **regression models** commonly used in statistics. We strive to explore **linear modelling approaches** as a primary step while highlighting different terminology found in both fields. Furthermore, this discussion is more comprehensive than a simple conceptual exploration. Hence, the second step is **hands-on practice** via the corresponding `Python` packages for machine learning and `R` for statistics.

## Fun fact!

While thinking about possible names for this work, I was planning to name it "*Machine Learning and Statistics: A Common Ground.*" Nevertheless, it was quite plain and boring! That said, this whole textbook idea sounded analogous to a **cookbook**[^1], given its heavily applied focus.\

**Hence, the cookbook name idea**!
