By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Describe why ordinary **linear models** and **multinomial logistic regression** are inappropriate for **ordered categorical outcomes**.

- Write down the ordinal regression likelihood and the cumulative logit link functions, express cumulative probabilities, and recover category probabilities.

- Understand the **proportional odds assumption** and how it constrains the model (common slope parameters across cutpoints).

- Understand how coefficient estimation via maximum likelihood works in this model.

- Interpret ordinal regression coefficients in real scenarios.

- Use **ordinal logistic regression** for prediction by computing cumulative and category-specific probabilities.

- Assess and diagnose the proportional odds assumption by the **Brant–Wald** test.

- Formulate and interpret **non-proportional odds models** when the proportional odds assumption is violated.

- Evaluate model performance and construct confidence intervals.

## Introduction

**Ordinal logistic regression** is a statistical modeling technique used to analyze relationships between an ordered multi-class categorical response variable and a set of explanatory variables. Unlike **multinomial logistic regression**, which treats categories as unordered, ordinal logistic regression take into account the natural ranking of response levels. Ignoring this ordering may lead to loss of valuable information in both **inference** and **prediction**.

In ordinal outcomes, the information lies **not only** in category membership **but also** in the relative ordering between categories. This structure is modeled through cumulative probabilities, which form the foundation of the cumulative logit (proportional odds) model. Instead of modeling the log-odds of each category relative to a baseline (as we do in multinomial regression), ordinal logistic regression models the **log-odds of being at or below a given category threshold**. That's right! We are looking at a cumulative probabbility now.

A key characteristic of the most commonly used ordinal models is the proportional odds model. It asserts that the effect of predictors is assumed to be constant across all cumulative splits of the response. This assumption plays a central role in the modeling framework and interpretation. To start this chpater let us see some of the assumptions in this model.


### Ordinal Logistic Regression Assumptions

The following are the assumptions that we need to be aware of before fitting this model:

- The response or dependent variable should be measured at the ordinal level with more than two ordered categories. This means there is a natural order between the categories in the response variable. For example likert scale: Strongly agree / Agree / Neutral / Disagree / Strongly Disagree

- There should be one or more independent variables that are continuous, ordinal, or nominal (including dichotomous variables).

- Logit linearity assumption: There must be a linear relationship between any continuous independent variables and the logit of the cumulative probabilities.

- Independent observations: The observations should be independent and the dependent variable should consist of mutually exclusive and exhaustive ordered categories.

- Proportional odds assumption: The relationship between each predictor and the log-odds of being at or below any category is constant across all category thresholds (parallel slopes assumption).

- When the proportional odds assumption is violated, a non-proportional odds model may be considered that allows for some predictors to vary across thresholds.


### Use Cases of Ordinal Logistic Regression

Ordinal logistic regression is particularly useful when the outcome has a meaningful ranking and collapsing categories would discard important structure. Some examples of this are:

1. Likert Scale Survey Responses: A classic example is agreement levels in surveys (Strongly disagree/ Disagree / Neutral / Agree / Strongly Agree). For example, you may study how predictors such as age, education, or exposure to misinformation influence the probability of showing extreme political ideas. 

2. Customer Satisfaction Levels: Marketing analysts may use ordinal regression to understand how service quality, wait time, or pricing influence the likelihood of higher satisfaction ratings.

3. Educational Achievement Levels: Educational researchers may study how study time, attendance in lectures and class activities, or prior preparation affects the probability of achieving higher results in exams.

4. Clinical Severity Scales: Ordinal models help quantify how treatments or patient characteristics influence the likelihood of more severe disease states. These status are often divided into categories such as mild, moderate, or severe.

In all these examples, the ordering is essential. Treating these outcomes as nominal would ignore the structured progression between categories, while treating them as numeric would impose unrealistic equal spacing. Ordinal logistic regression provides a principled framework that respects the ranking while maintaining probabilistic modeling rigor.
