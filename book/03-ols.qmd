**Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** is a foundational method in regression analysis that estimates the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. At its core, OLS aims to minimize the difference, or "error," between the observed values and the values predicted by the model. It does this by finding the best-fitting line (or hyperplane in the case of multiple variables) that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values.

The importance of OLS lies in its simplicity, interpretability, and wide applicability. As one of the earliest and most widely used techniques in statistics and machine learning, OLS provides a straightforward approach to understanding how variables influence each other. In areas such as economics, biology, and social sciences, OLS has enabled researchers to model and quantify relationships, making it a powerful tool for both inference and prediction.

The usefulness of OLS extends beyond its ease of use. Its ability to provide clear parameter estimates—coefficients that describe the strength and direction of relationships between variables—makes it a valuable tool for decision-making. Whether predicting financial outcomes, assessing medical treatments, or understanding consumer behavior, OLS offers a framework for transforming raw data into actionable insights.

In this chapter, we will explore how OLS works, its assumptions, and how we can apply it to real-world data to solve problems, while also understanding its limitations. Through this, we aim to build a strong foundation in regression analysis that will serve as a stepping stone to more advanced techniques.
