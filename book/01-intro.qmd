It is time to prepare for all the different regression techniques we will check beginning @sec-ols. That said, there is a strong message we want to convey across all this work:

> **Different modelling estimation techniques in regression analysis can be smoothly grasped when we develop a fair probabilistic and inferential intuition on our populations or systems of interest.**

The above statement has a fundamental statistical foundation on how data is generated and can be modelled via different regression approaches. More details on the concepts and ideas associated with this foundation will be delivered in @sec-stats-review. Hence, before reviewing these statistical concepts and ideas, this chapter will elaborate on the three big pillars we previously pointed out in **Audience and Scope**: 

1. The use of an ordered **data science workflow** in @sec-ds-workflow,
2. choosing the proper workflow flavour according to either an **inferential** or **predictive** paradigm as shown in @fig-ds-workflow, and
2. the correct use of an **appropriate regression model** based on the response or outcome of interest as shown in the mind map from @sec-regression-mindmap (analogous to a **regression toolbox**).

# The Rationale Behind the Three Pillars

Each data science-related problem that uses regression analysis might have distinctive characteristics considering inferential (statistics!) or predictive (machine learning!) inquiries. Specific problems would implicate using outcomes (or responses) related to survival times (e.g., the time until one particular equipment of a given brand fails), categories (e.g., a preferred musical genre in the Canadian young population), counts (e.g., how many customers we would expect on a regular Monday morning in the branches of a major national bank), etc. Moreover, under this regression context, our analyses would be expanded to explore and assess how our outcome of interest is related to a further set of variables (the so-called features!). For instance, following up with the categorical outcome of the preferred musical genre in the Canadian young population, we might analyze how particular age groups prefer certain genres over others or even how preferred genres compare each other across different Canadian provinces in this young population. **The sky is the limit here!**\

Therefore, we might be tempted to say that each regression problem should have its own workflow, given that the regression model to use would implicate particular analysis phases. **However, it turns out that is not the case to a certain extent**, and we have a regression workflow in @fig-ds-workflow to support this bold statement as a proof of concept for thirteen different regression models (i.e, thirteen chapters in this book aside from the probability and statistics review). The workflow aims to homogenize our data analyses and make our modelling process more transparent and smoother. We can adequately deliver concluding insights as data storytelling while addressing our initial main inquiries. Of course, when depicting the workflow as a flowchart, there will be decision points that will turn it into **inferential** or **predictive** (the second pillar). Finally, where does the third pillar come into play in this workflow? This pillar is contained in the **data modelling stage**, where the mind map from @fig-regression-mindmap will come in handy.
:::

Moving along, let us establish a convention on the use of admonitions beginning @sec-ml-stats-dictionary in this textbook:

::: {#imp-example .callout-important}
# Definition

A formal statistical and/or machine learning definition. This admonition aims to untangle the significant amount of jargon and concepts that both fields have. Furthermore, alternative terminology will be brought up when necessary to indicate the same definition across both fields.
:::

::: {#nte-example .callout-note}
# Heads-up!

An idea (or ideas!) of key relevance for any given modelling approach, specific workflow stage or data science-related terminology. This admonition also extends to crucial statistical or machine learning topics that the reader would be interested in exploring more in-depth. 
:::

::: {#tip-example .callout-tip}
# Tip

An idea (or ideas!) that might be slightly out of the scope of the topic any specific section is discussing. Still, we will provide significant insights on the matter along with further literature references to look for.
:::

The core idea of the above admonition arrangement is to allow the reader to discern between ideas or concepts that are key to grasp from those whose understanding might not be highly essential (but still interesting to check out in further literature!). Before jumping into our three pillars in sections @sec-ds-workflow and @sec-regression-mindmap, let us elaborate on an additional resource related to setting a **common ground** between **machine learning** and **statistics**.

## The ML-Stats Dictionary {#sec-ml-stats-dictionary}

Machine learning and statistics usually overlap across many subjects, and regression modelling is no exception. Topics we teach in an utterly regression-based course, under a purely statistical framework, also appear in machine learning-based courses such as fundamental supervised learning, but often with different terminology. On this basis, the Master of Data Science (MDS) program at the University of British Columbia (UBC) provides the [MDS Stat-ML dictionary](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/terminology/) [@gelbart2017] under the following premises:

> *This document is intended to help students navigate the large amount of jargon, terminology, and acronyms encountered in the MDS program and beyond.*

> *This section covers terms that have different meanings in different contexts, specifically statistics vs. machine learning (ML).*

Indeed, both disciplines have a tremendous amount of jargon and terminology. Furthermore, as previously emphasized in the **Preface**, machine learning and statistics construct a **substantial synergy** reflected in data science. Even with this, people in both fields could encounter miscommunication issues when working together. This should not happen if we build solid bridges between both disciplines. Therefore, the above admonition in @imp-example for a **definition** will pave the way to a complimentary resource called the **ML-Stats dictionary** (*ML* stands for *Machine Learning*). This comprehensive **ML-Stats dictionary** is imperative, and our textbook offers a perfect opportunity to build this resource. Primarily, this dictionary will clarify any potential confusion between statistics and machine learning regarding terminology within supervised learning and regression analysis contexts. 

::: {#nte-term-highlight .callout-note}
# Heads-up on terminology highlights!

Following the spirit of the **ML-Stats dictionary**, throughout the book, all `r colourize("statistical", "blue")` terms will be highlighted in `r colourize("blue", "blue")` whereas the `r colourize("machine learning", "magenta")` terms will be highlighted in `r colourize("magenta", "magenta")`. This colour scheme strives to combine this terminology so we can switch from one field to another in an easier way. With practice and time, we should be able to jump back and forth when using these concepts.
:::

Finally, @sec-dictionary will be the section in this book where the reader can find all those `r colourize("statistical", "blue")` and `r colourize("machine learning-related", "magenta")` terms in alphabetical order. Notable terms (either statistical or machine learning-related) will include an admonition identifying which terms (again, either statistical or machine learning-related) are **equivalent** (**or NOT equivalent if that is the case**). Take as an example the statistical term `r colourize("dependent variable", "blue")`:

> In supervised learning, it is the main variable of interest we are trying to **learn** or **predict**, or equivalently, the variable we are trying **explain** in a statistical inference framework.

Then, the above definition will be followed by this admonition:

::: {.callout-warning}
## Equivalent to:

`r colourize("Response", "blue")`, `r colourize("outcome", "magenta")`, `r colourize("output", "magenta")` or `r colourize("target", "magenta")`.
:::

Above, we have identified four equivalent terms for the term `r colourize("dependent variable", "blue")`. Furthermore, according to our already defined colour scheme, these terms can be `r colourize("statistical", "blue")` or `r colourize("machine learning-related", "magenta")`. Finally, note we will start using this colour scheme in @sec-stats-review.

::: {#nte-use-terminology .callout-note}
# Heads-up on the use of terminology!

Throughout this book, we will interchangeably use specific terms when explaining the different regression approaches in each chapter. Whenever confusion arises about using these interchangeable terms, it is highly recommended to consult their definitions and equivalences (or non-equivalences) in @sec-dictionary.
:::

Now, let us proceed to explaining the three pillars on which this textbook is built upon: a **data science workflow**, the right **workflow flavour** (**inferential** or **predictive**), and a **regression toolbox**. 

## The Data Science Workflow {#sec-ds-workflow}

Understanding the data science workflow is essential for mastering regression analysis. This workflow serves as a blueprint that guides us through each stage of our analysis, ensuring that we apply a systematic approach to solving our inquiries in a reproducible way. Each of the three pillars of this textbook—data science workflow, the right workflow flavor (inferential or predictive), and a regression toolbox—are deeply interconnected. Regardless of the regression model we explore, this general workflow provides a consistent framework that helps us navigate our data analysis with clarity and purpose. As shown in @fig-ds-workflow, the data science workflow is composed of the following stages (each of which will be discussed in more detail in subsequent subsections):

1. **Study design:** This stage involves defining the research question, objectives, and variables of interest to ensure the analysis is purpose-driven.
2. **Data collection and wrangling:** Gathering and cleaning data to transform it into a usable format by addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. **Exploratory data analysis:** Exploring the data through statistical summaries and visualizations to identify patterns, trends, and potential anomalies.
4. **Data modelling:** Applying statistical or machine learning models to uncover relationships between variables or make predictions based on the data.
5. **Estimation:** Calculating model parameters to quantify the relationships between variables and assess the model’s accuracy.
6. **Goodness of fit:** Evaluating how well the model explains the data by using performance metrics and diagnostic checks.
6. **Results:** Interpreting the model's outputs to derive insights and answer the original research question.
7. **Storytelling** Communicating the findings in a clear, engaging narrative that is accessible to a non-technical audience.

::: {#note-no-formal .callout-note}
# What if there is no formal structure in our regression analysis?

Since very early learning stages in data analysis, it is crucial tp

Now, suppose we do not follow a predefined workflow in practice. In that case, we might be at stake in incorrectly addressing our inquiries, translating into meaningless results outside the context of the problem we aim to solve. This is why the formation of a Data Scientist must stress this workflow from the very introductory learning stages.

![](img/data-science-workflow.png){width="1000"} 

Data science workflow for *inferential* and *predictive* inquiries in regression analysis and supervised learning, respectively.
:::

### Study Design {#sec-ds-workflow-study-design}

The first stage of this workflow is heavily related to the *main statistical inquiries* we aim to address throughout the whole data analysis process. As a data scientist, it is your task to primarily translate these inquiries from the stakeholders of the problem as *inferential* or *predictive*. Roughly speaking, this primary classification can be explained as follows:

- **Inferential.** The main objective is to untangle relationships of *association* or *causation* between the regressors (i.e., explanatory variables) and the corresponding response in the context of the problem of interest. Firstly, we would assess whether there is a statistical relationship between them. Then, if significant, we would quantify by how much.
- **Predictive.** The main objective is to deliver response predictions on further observations of regressors, having estimated a given model via a current training dataset. Unlike inferential inquiries, assessing a statistically significant association or causation between our variables of interest is not a primary objective but *accurate predictions*. **This is one of the fundamental paradigms of machine learning.**

![](img/study-design.png){width="670"}

*Study design* stage from the data science workflow in @fig-ds-workflow. This stage is directly followed by *data collection and wrangling*.
:::

### Data Collection and Wrangling {#sec-ds-workflow-data-collection}

Once we have defined our main statistical inquiries, it is time to collect our data. Note we have to be careful about the way we collect this data since it might have a particular impact on the quality of our statistical practice:

- Regarding inferential inquiries, recall we are approaching populations or systems of interest governed by *unknown and fixed distributional parameters*. Thus, via sampled data, we aim to *estimate* these distributional parameters. This is why **a proper sampling method** on this population or system of interest is critical to obtaining representative data for *appropriate hypothesis testing*.

::: {#tip-sampling .callout-tip}
# A Quick Debrief on Sampling!

Sampling topics are out of the scope of this book. Nevertheless, we still need to stress that a  proper sampling method is also key in inferential inquiries to assess association and/or causation between the regressors and your response of interest. That said, depending on the context of the problem, we could apply either one of the following methods of sampling:

- **Simple random sampling**.
- **Systematic sampling**.
- **Stratified sampling**.
- **Clustered sampling**.
- Etc.

As in the case of Regression Analysis, statistical sampling is a vast field, and we could spend a whole course on it. If you are more interested in these topics, [*Sampling: design and analysis*](https://webcat.library.ubc.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=2206157) by Lohr offers great foundations.
:::


- In practice, regarding predictive inquiries, we would likely have to deal with databases given that our trained models will not be used to make inference and parameter interpretations.

## Mindmap of Regression Analysis {#sec-regression-mindmap}

Having defined the necessary statistical aspects to execute a proper supervised learning analysis, either *inferential* or *predictive* across its seven sequential phases, we must dig into the different approaches we might encounter in practice as regression models. The nature of our outcome of interest will dictate any given modelling approach to apply, depicted as clouds in @fig-regression-mindmap. Note these regression models can be split into two sets depending on whether the outcome of interest is *continuous* or *discrete*. Therefore, under a probabilistic view, identifying the nature of a given random variable is crucial in regression analysis.

Regression analysis mindmap depicting all modelling techniques to be explored in this book. These techniques are split into two big sets: *continuous* and *discrete* outcomes.
:::

That said, we will go beyond OLS regression and explore further regression techniques. In practice, these techniques have been developed in the statistical literature to address practical cases where the OLS modelling framework and assumptions are not suitable anymore. Thus, throughout this block, we will cover (at least) one new regression model per lecture.

As we can see in the clouds of @fig-regression-mindmap, there are 13 regression models: 8 belonging to discrete outcomes and 5 to continuous outcomes. Each of these models is contained in a chapter of this book, beginning with the most basic regression tool known as ordinary least-squares in @sec-ols. We must clarify that the current statistical literature is not restricted to these 13 regression models. The field of regression analysis is vast, and one might encounter more complex models to target certain specific inquiries. Nonetheless, I consider these models the fundamental regression approaches that any data scientist must be familiar with in everyday practice.

Even though this book comprises 13 chapters, each depicting a different regression model, we have split these chapters into two major subsets: those with *continuous* outcomes and those with *discrete* outcomes.
