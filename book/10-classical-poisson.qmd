## Introduction

Let’s imagine you're someone who receives a steady stream of emails throughout the workday. You’ve noticed over the past month that you typically get about 10 emails per day, but the actual number varies — some days it’s 8, other days it’s 12, and occasionally it spikes to 15 or drops to 4. You start to wonder: 

> Is there a pattern to how many emails I get? Can I predict the likelihood of receiving a certain number tomorrow?

This type of question is exactly what the Poisson distribution is designed to answer. It's a tool we use when we want to model the number of times an event happens — like getting an email — within a fixed time frame, like a day.

What makes the Poisson distribution especially handy is that it doesn't require a cap on the number of emails you might receive, and it assumes that these emails come in independently and at a constant average rate. In this case, that average rate is 10 emails per day. Using this distribution, we can calculate the probability of getting exactly 5 emails tomorrow, or more than 12, or even no emails at all.

## What is the Poisson Distribution?

The **Poisson distribution** is a probability model for count data. It tells us how likely we are to observe 0, 1, 2, 3, … events in a given time or space window, assuming the events occur randomly but at a stable average rate. You can use it not just for emails, but for things like the number of customers arriving at a coffee shop in an hour, the number of traffic accidents at an intersection in a week, or the number of typos in a printed book per page.

Rather than predicting a precise outcome, the Poisson distribution gives us a probability for each possible count, letting us understand what is typical, rare, or unexpected — all based on the average rate of occurrence.

## From Intuition to Definition

So far, we’ve seen how the Poisson distribution can be used to model the number of emails someone receives per day. If you typically get 10 emails a day, we might want to answer questions like:

> “What’s the chance I get exactly 7 emails tomorrow?”
> “How likely is it that I’ll receive 0 emails?”
> “What’s the probability I’ll get 15 or more?”

To answer these, we need to formally define the Poisson distribution and understand how it behaves mathematically.

The Poisson distribution models the probability of observing a given number of events, say $y$, in a fixed interval of time or space, given that:

1. The events occur independently of each other.
2. The events occur at a constant average rate, denoted by λ (lambda).
3. The events are discrete, meaning we count them as whole numbers (e.g., you can’t receive 3.7 emails).

In this context, $\lambda$ represents the expected number of events per interval. In our email example, that’s $\lambda=10$ emails per day.

## The Poisson Probability Formula

The probability of observing exactly $y$ events in a fixed interval, when the average rate is $\lambda$, is given by the **Poisson probability mass function**:

$$
P(Y = y) = \frac{\lambda^y e^{-\lambda}}{y!}
$$
 
This formula might look a little intimidating at first, but let’s break it down:

- $Y$ is the random variable representing the number of events (e.g., emails).
- $y$ is the specific count we’re interested in (e.g., exactly 7 emails).
- $\lambda$ is the average number of events per interval (e.g., 10 emails per day).
- $e$ is the mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.718.
- $y!$ is the factorial of $y$, which just means $y \times (y-1) \times \cdots \times 1$.

Using this formula, we can compute the probability of receiving exactly 7 emails tomorrow, or any other count we care about, as long as we know the average rate.

For instance, if $\lambda=10$, and we want the probability of receiving exactly 7 emails:

$$
P(Y = 7) = \frac{10^7 e^{-10}}{7!}
$$
 
This can be computed using a calculator or software like Python or R, which we’ll get to in a later section.


## Key Properties of the Poisson Distribution

One of the most interesting things about the Poisson distribution is that its mean and variance are both equal to $\lambda$. So in our case, not only is the average number of emails per day 10, but the variability in the number of emails also has a spread characterized by 10. This tight connection between the mean and variance is a hallmark of the Poisson model, and as we’ll see later, it also gives us clues about when the Poisson model may or may not be appropriate.
