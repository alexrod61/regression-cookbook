The regression mind map is a key component of the philosophy behind this book, besides the **data science workflow** from @sec-ds-workflow and the **ML-Stats dictionary** found in @sec-dictionary. @fig-app-regression shows this regression mind map split in two zones by colour: *discrete* and *continuous*. This regression mind map is handy when executing the **data modelling** stage from the data science workflow, as explained in @sec-ds-workflow-modelling. Recall the first step in this stage is to **choose a suitable regression model**, and we made this decision in the function of the type of outcome $Y$ we are dealing with. That said, the **distributional mind map** from @fig-app-distributions complements the regression mind map when identifying the correct type of outcome $Y$.

Regression analysis mind map depicting all modelling techniques to be explored in this book. Depending on the type of outcome $Y$, these techniques are split into two large zones: discrete and continuous.
:::

Suppose we start reading this regression map clockwise in the continuous zone. In that case, note this zone starts with the cloud corresponding to @sec-ols on the regression model called **Ordinary Least-squares (OLS)**. Moreover, we can see that OLS is meant for an unbounded outcome $Y \in (-\infty, \infty)$. Then, we can proceed to the distributional assumption on $Y$ in OLS, which would be Normal. Following up with the cloud corresponding to @sec-gamma on the generalized linear model (GLM) called **Gamma regression**, we can see this model is meant for a nonnegative outcome $Y \in [0, \infty)$ where we assume a Gamma distribution for $Y$. This way of reading the continuous zone in the mind map will persist until the **survival analysis** models: @sec-parametric-survival and @sec-semiparametric-survival.

Then, we can proceed to the discrete zone with the cloud corresponding to @sec-binary-logistic on the GLM called **Binary Logistic regression** which aims to model a binary outcome $Y \in \{0, 1 \}$. Note that the Binary Logistic regression model is meant for **ungrouped data** where each row in the training dataset contains unique feature values. Hence, in this modelling case, we assume the outcome $Y$ as a Bernoulli trial where $1$ indicates a *success* and $0$ indicates a *failure*. Then, suppose we take another clockwise case such as @sec-classical-poisson on the GLM called **Classical Poisson regression**, this model is suitable for count-type outcomes where equidispersion is present (i.e., the mean of the counts is equal to its corresponding variance). Finally, this model assumes that the outcome is Poisson-distributed. This way of reading the discrete zone in the mind map will persist until @sec-ordinal-logistic on the GLM called **Ordinal Logistic Regression**.
