Machine learning and statistics comprise a **substantial synergy** that is reflected in data science. Thus, it is imperative to construct solid bridges between both disciplines to ensure everything is clear regarding their tremendous amount of jargon and terminology. This **ML-Stats dictionary** (*ML* stands for *Machine Learning*) aims to be one of these bridges in this textbook, especially within supervised learning and regression analysis contexts.

Below, you will find definitions either highlighted in `r colourize("blue", "blue")` if they correspond to `r colourize("statistical", "blue")` terminology or `r colourize("magenta", "magenta")` if the terminology is `r colourize("machine learning-related", "magenta")`. These definitions come from all **definition** admonitions, such as in @Definition-sample. This colour scheme strives to combine all terminology to switch from one field to another easily. With practice and time, we should be able to jump back and forth when using these concepts.

Let $Y$ be a `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` whose support is $\mathcal{Y}$. In general, the `r colourize("expected  value", "blue")` or `r colourize("mean", "blue")` $\mathbb{E}(Y)$ of this `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` is defined as a **weighted** `r colourize("average", "blue")` according to its corresponding `r colourize("probability distribution", "blue")`.

$$
\mathbb{E}(Y) = \sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} y \cdot P_Y(Y = y).

## B {.unnumbered}

### `r colourize("Bayesian statistics", "blue")` {.unnumbered}

This statistical school of thinking also relies on the **frequency of events** to estimate specific `r colourize("parameters", "blue")` of interest in a `r colourize("population", "blue")` or **system**.  Nevertheless, unlike `r colourize("frequentist", "blue")` statistics, `r colourize("Bayesian", "blue")` statisticians use **prior knowledge** on the `r colourize("population parameters", "blue")` to update their estimations on them along with the **current evidence** they can gather. This evidence is in the form of the repetition of $n$ experiments involving a random phenomenon. All these ingredients allow `r colourize("Bayesian", "blue")` statisticians to make inference by conducting  appropriate `r colourize("hypothesis testings", "blue")`, which are designed differently from their mainstream `r colourize("frequentist", "blue")` counterpart.

Under the umbrella of this approach, we assume that our governing `r colourize("parameters", "blue")` are **random**; i.e., they have their own `r colourize("sample space", "blue")` and `r colourize("probabilities", "blue")` associated to their corresponding outcomes. The statistical process of inference is heavily backed up by **probability theory** mostly in the form of the **Bayes theorem** (named after Reverend **Thomas Bayes**, an English statistician from the 18th century). This theorem uses our **current evidence** along with our **prior beliefs** to deliver a **posterior distribution** of our **random** `r colourize("parameter(s)", "blue")` of interest.

### `r colourize("Critical value", "blue")` {.unnumbered}

Let $Y$ be a `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` whose support is $\mathcal{Y}$. If this support $\mathcal{Y}$ corresponds to an uncountably infinite set of possible values, then $Y$ is considered a `r colourize("continuous random variable", "blue")`.

Note a `r colourize("continuous random variable", "blue")` could be 

- **completely unbounded** (i.e., its set of possible values goes from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ as in $-\infty < y < \infty$), 
- **positively unbounded** (i.e., its set of possible values goes from $0$ to $\infty$ as in $0 \leq y < \infty$), 
- **negatively unbounded** (i.e., its set of possible values goes from $-\infty$ to $0$ as in $-\infty < y \leq 0$), or
- **bounded** between two values $a$ and $b$ (i.e., its set of possible values goes from $a$ to $b$ as in $a \leq y \leq b$).

For instance, we can encounter `r colourize("discrete random variables", "blue")` which could be classified as

- **binary** (i.e., a finite set of two possible values),
- **categorical** (either **nominal** or **ordinal**, which have a finite set of three or more possible values), or

Probabilistically, a `r colourize("measure of central tendency", "blue")` is defined as a metric that identifies a **central or typical value** of a given `r colourize("probability distribution", "blue")`. In other words, a `r colourize("measure of central tendency", "blue")` refers to a **central or typical value** that a given `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` might take when we observe various realizations of this variable over a long period.

### `r colourize("Measure of uncertainty", "blue")` {.unnumbered}

Probabilistically, a `r colourize("measure of uncertainty", "blue")` refers to the **spread** of a given `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` when we observe its different realizations in the long term. Note a **larger spread** indicates more variability in these realizations. On the other hand, a **smaller spread** denotes less variability in these realizations.

It is a characteristic (**numerical** or even **non-numerical**, such as a **distinctive category**) that **summarizes** the state of our `r colourize("population", "blue")` or **system** of interest.

Note the **standard mathematical notation** for `r colourize("population parameters", "blue")` are **Greek letters**. Moreover, in practice, these `r colourize("population parameter(s)", "blue")` of interest will be **unknown** to the data scientist or researcher. Instead, they would use formal statistical inference to **estimate** them.

### `r colourize("Population", "blue")` {.unnumbered}

It is a **whole collection of individuals or items** that share **distinctive attributes**. As data scientists or researchers, we are interested in studying these attributes, which we assume are **governed** by `r colourize("parameters", "blue")`. In practice, we must be **as specific as possible** when defining our given `r colourize("population", "blue")` such that we would frame our entire data modelling process since its very early stages.

Note that the term `r colourize("population", "blue")` could be exchanged for the term **system**, given that certain contexts do not specifically refer to individuals or items. Instead, these contexts could refer to **processes** whose attributes are also governed by `r colourize("parameters", "blue")`.

### `r colourize("Probability", "blue")` {.unnumbered}

Let $A$ be an event of interest in a random phenomenon, in a `r colourize("population", "blue")` or **system** of interest, whose all possible outcomes belong to a given `r colourize("sample space", "blue")` $S$. Generally, the `r colourize("probability", "blue")` for this event $A$ happening can be mathematically depicted as $P(A)$. Moreover, **suppose we observe the random phenomenon $n$ times** such as we were running some class of experiment, then $P(A)$ is defined as the following ratio:

$$
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of times event $A$ is observed}}{n},
$${#eq-probability-dictionary}

**as the $n$ times we observe the random phenomenon goes to infinity.**

@eq-probability-dictionary will always put $P(A)$ in the following numerical range:

$$
0 \leq P(A) \leq 1.
$$

### `r colourize("Probability distribution", "blue")` {.unnumbered}

When we set a `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` $Y$, we also set a new set of $v$ possible outcomes $\mathcal{Y} = \{ y_1, \dots, y_v\}$ coming from the `r colourize("sample space", "blue")` $S$. This new set of possible outcomes $\mathcal{Y}$ corresponds to the range of the `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` $Y$ (i.e., all the possible values that could be taken on once we execute a given random experiment involving $Y$). 

That said, let us suppose we have a `r colourize("sample space", "blue")` of $u$ elements defined as 

$$
S = \{ s_1, \dots, s_u \},
$$

where each one of these elements has a `r colourize("probability", "blue")` assigned via a function $P_S(\cdot)$ such that

$$
P(S) = \sum_{i = 1}^u P_S(s_i) = 1.
$$

which has to satisfy @eq-sample-space-app.

Then, the `r colourize("probability distribution", "blue")` of $Y$, i.e., $P_Y(\cdot)$ assigns a `r colourize("probability", "blue")` to each **observed value** $Y = y_j$ (with $j = 1, \dots, v$) if and only if the outcome of the random experiment belongs to the `r colourize("sample space", "blue")`, i.e., $s_i \in S$ (for $i = 1, \dots, u$) such that $Y(s_i) = y_j$:

$$
P_Y(Y = y_j) = P \left( \left\{ s_i \in S : Y(s_i) = y_j \right\} \right).
$$

### `r colourize("Probability density function (PDF)", "blue")` {.unnumbered}

$$
f_Y(y) : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

with

$$
f_Y(y) \geq 0.
$$

Then, $f_Y(y)$ is considered a `r colourize("probability density function (PDF)", "blue")` if the `r colourize("probability", "blue")` of $Y$ taking on a value within the range represented by the subset $A \subset \mathcal{Y}$ is equal to

$$
P_Y(Y \in A) = \int_A f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y
$$

with

$$
\int_{\mathcal{Y}} f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y = 1.
$$

### `r colourize("Probability mass function (PMF)", "blue")` {.unnumbered}

Let $Y$ be a `r colourize("discrete random variable", "blue")` whose support is $\mathcal{Y}$. Moreover, suppose that $Y$ has a `r colourize("probability distribution", "blue")` such that

$$
P_Y(Y = y) : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow [0, 1]
$$

where, for all $y \notin \mathcal{Y}$, we have

$$
P_Y(Y = y) = 0 
$$

and

$$
\sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} P_Y(Y = y) = 1.
$$
Then, $P_Y(Y = y)$ is considered a `r colourize("probability mass function (PMF)", "blue")`.

Let $A$ be an event of interest in a random phenomenon in a `r colourize("population", "blue")` or **system** of interest. The `r colourize("sample space", "blue")` $S$ of event $A$ denotes the set of all the possible **random outcomes** we might encounter every time we randomly observe $A$ such as we were running some class of experiment.

Note each of these outcomes has a determined probability associated with them. If we add up all these probabilities, the probability of the sample $S$ will be one, i.e.,

$$
P(S) = 1.
