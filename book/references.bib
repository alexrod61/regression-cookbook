  abstract = {A new generalization of the Poisson distribution, with two parameters λ 1 and λ 2 is obtained as a limiting form of the generalized negative binomial distribution. The variance of the distribution is greater than, equal to or smaller than the mean according as λ 2 is positive, zero or negative. The distribution gives a very close fit to supposedly binomial, Poisson and negative-binomial data and provides with a model suitable to most unimodel or reverse J-shaped distributions. Diagrams showing the variations in the form of the distribution for different values of λ 1 and λ 2 are given.},
