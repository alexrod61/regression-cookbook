# Audience and Scope {.unnumbered}

This book mainly focuses on **regression analysis** and its **supervised learning** counterpart. Thus, it is not introductory statistics and machine learning material. Also, some coding background on `R` [@r2024] and/or `Python` [@python] is recommended. That said, the following topics are suggested as **fundamental reviews**:

- **Mutivariable differential calculus and linear algebra.** Certain sections of each chapter pertain to modelling estimation. Therefore, topics such as *partial derivatives* and *matrix algebra* are a great asset. You can find helpful learning resources on the [MDS webpage](https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/learning_resources/).
- **Basic `Python` programming.** When necessary, `Python` [{pandas}](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/) [@pandas2024] library will be used to perform *data wrangling*. The MDS course [DSCI 511 (Programming for Data Science)](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_511_prog-dsci) is an ideal example of a quick review.

- **Basic `R` programming.** Knowledge of *data wrangling and plotting* through `R` [{tidyverse}](https://www.tidyverse.org) [@tidyverse] is recommended for hands-on practice via the cases provided in each one of the chapters of this book. The MDS courses [DSCI 523 (Programming for Data Manipulation)](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_523_r-prog) and [DSCI 531 (Data Visualization I)](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_531_viz-1) are ideal examples of a quick review.
- **Foundations of probability and basic distributional knowledge.** The reader should be familiar with elemental *discrete and continuous distributions* since they are a vital component of any given regression or supervised learning model. The MDS course [DSCI 551 (Descriptive Statistics and Probability for Data Science)](https://ubc-mds.github.io/course-descriptions/DSCI_551_eda-dsci/) is an ideal example of a quick review.
- **Foundations of frequentist statistical inference.** One of the data science paradigms to be covered in this book is *statistical inference*, i.e., identifying relationships between different variables in a given *population or system* of interest via a *sampled dataset*. I only aim to cover a frequentist approach using inferential tools such as *parameter estimation*, *hypothesis testing*, and *confidence intervals*. The MDS course [DSCI 552 (Statistical Inference and Computation I)](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_552_stat-inf-1) is an ideal example of a quick review.
- **Foundations of supervised learning.** The second data science paradigm to be covered pertains to *prediction*, which is core in machine learning. The reader should be familiar with basic terminology, such as *training and testing data*, *overfitting*, *underfitting*, *cross-validation*, etc. The MDS course [DSCI 571 (Machine Learning I)](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_571_sup-learn-1) provides these foundations.
- **Foundations of feature and model selection.** This prerequisite also relates to machine learning and its corresponding prediction paradigm. Basic knowledge of *prediction accuracy* and *variable selection tools* is recommended. The MDS course [DSCI 573 (Feature and Model Selection)](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_573_feat-model-select) is an ideal example of a quick review.

## A further remark on probability and statistical inference

In case the reader is not 100% familiar with probabilistic and inferential topics, as discussed above, we will provide a fundamental refresher in @sec-stats-review with crucial points that are needed to follow along the **statistical way** each one of the chapters is delivered (more specifically for **modelling estimation/training** matters!).\

Furthermore, this refresher will be integrated into **the three big pillars** that will be fully expanded in this book, more concretely in @sec-intro: a **data science workflow**, the right **workflow flavour** (**inferential** or **predictive**), and a **regression toolbox**.
