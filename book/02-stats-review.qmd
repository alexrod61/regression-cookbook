This chapter will delve into probability and frequentist statistical inference. We can view these sections as a quick review of introductory probability and statistics concepts. Moreover, this review will be important to understanding the philosophy of modelling parameter estimation as outlined in @sec-ds-workflow-estimation. Then, we will pave the way to the rationale behind statistical inference in the **Results** stage (as in @sec-ds-workflow-results) in our workflow from @fig-ds-workflow. Note that we aim to explain all these statistical and probabilistic concepts in the most possible practical way via a made-up case study throughout this chapter **(while still presenting useful theoretical admonitions as explained in @sec-intro)**. Note we will use an appropriate level of jargon and will follow the colour convention found in @sec-dictionary along with the [definition callout box](#Definition-sample).

> **Let us start with a relatable story!** 

Imagine you are an undergraduate engineering student. Moreover, last term, you just took and passed your first course in probability and statistics (inference included!) in an industrial engineering context. Moreover, as it could happen while taking an introductory course in probability and statistics, you used to feel quite overwhelmed by the large amount of jargon and formulas one had to grasp and use regularly for primary engineering fields such as quality control in a manufacturing facility. *Population parameters*, *hypothesis testing*, *tests statistics*, *significance level*, *$p$-values*, and *confidence intervals* (**do not worry, our `r colourize("statistical", "blue")`/`r colourize("machine learning", "magenta")` scheme will come in later in this review**) were appearing here and there! And to your frustration, you could never find a statistical connection between all these inferential tools! Instead, you relied on mechanistic procedures when solving assignments or exam problems. 

For instance, when performing hypothesis testing for a two-sample $t$-test, you struggled to reflect what the hypotheses were trying to indicate for the corresponding population parameters or how the test statistic was related to these hypotheses. Moreover, your interpretation of the resulting $p$-value and/or confidence interval was purely mechanical with the inherent claim: 

> *With a significance level $\alpha = 0.05$, we reject (**or fail to reject, if that is the case!**) the null hypothesis in given that...* 

Truthfully, this whole mechanical way of doing statistics is not ideal in a teaching, research or industry environment. AlongÂ the same lines, the above situation should also not happen when we learn key statistical topics for the very first time as undergraduate students. That is why we will investigate a more intuitive way of viewing probability and its crucial role in statistical inference. This matter will help us deliver more coherent storytelling (as in @sec-ds-workflow-storytelling) when presenting our results in practice during any regression analysis to our peers or stakeholders. Note that the role of probability also extends to model training (as in @sec-ds-workflow-estimation) when it comes to supervised learning and not just regarding statistical inference.

Having said all this, it is time to introduce a statement that is key when teaching hypothesis testing in an introductory statistical inference course:

> **In statistical inference, everything always boils down to randomness and how we can control it!**

That is quite a bold statement! Nonetheless, once one starts teaching statistical topics to audiences not entirely familiar with the usual field jargon, the idea of randomness always persists across many different tools. And, of course, regression analysis is not an exception at all since it also involves inference on population parameters of interest! This is why we have allocated this section in the textbook to explain core probabilistic and inferential concepts to pave the way to its role in regression analysis.

::: {.Heads-up}
::::{.Heads-up-header}
Heads-up on why we mean as a non-ideal mechanical analysis!
::::
::::{.Heads-up-container}
The reader might need clarification on why the mechanical way of performing hypothesis testing is considered **non-ideal**, mainly when the term **cookbook** is used in the book's title. The **cookbook** concept here actually refers to a homogenized recipe for data modelling, as seen in the workflow from @fig-ds-workflow. However, there's a crucial distinction between this and the non-ideal mechanical way of hypothesis testing.

On the one hand, the non-ideal mechanical way refers to **the use of a tool without understanding the rationale of what this tool stands for**, resulting in vacuous and standard statements that we would not be able to explain any way further, such as the statement we previously indicated:

> *With a significance level $\alpha = 0.05$, we reject (**or fail to reject, if that is the case!**) the null hypothesis given that...*

What if a stakeholder of our analysis asks us in plain words what a significance level means? Why are we phrasing our conclusion on the null hypothesis and not directly on the alternative one? As a data scientist, one should be able to explain why the whole inference process yields that statement without misleading the stakeholders' understanding. **For sure, this also implicates appropriate communication skills that cater to general audiences rather than just technical ones.**

Conversely, the data modelling workflow in @fig-ds-workflow involves stages that necessitate a comprehensive and precise understanding of our analysis. Progressing to the next stage (without a complete grasp of the current one) risks perpetuating false insights, potentially leading to faulty data storytelling of the entire analysis.
::::
:::

Finally, even though this book has suggested reviews related to the basics of probability via different distributions and the fundamentals of frequentist statistical inference as stated in [Audience and Scope](https://alexrod61.github.io/regression-cookbook/book/audience-scope.html), we will retake essential concepts as follows:

- The role of *random variables* and *probability distributions* and the governance of *population (or system) parameters* (i.e., the so-called Greek letters we usually see in statistical inference and regression analysis). @sec-basics-prob will explore these topics more in detail while connecting them to the subsequent inferential terrain under a *frequentist context*.
- When delving into supervised learning and regression analysis, we might wonder how randomness is incorporated into *model fitting* (i.e., *parameter estimation*). That is quite a fascinating aspect, implemented via a crucial statistical tool known as *maximum likelihood estimation*. This tool is heavily related to the concept of *loss function* in supervised learning. @sec-mle will explore these matters in more detail and how the idea of a *random sample* is connected to this estimation tool.
- @sec-basics-inf will explore the basics of *hypothesis testing* and its intrinsic components such as *null* and *alternative hypotheses*, *type I* and *type II* errors, *significance level*, *power*, *observed effect*, *standard error*, *test statistic*, *critical value*, *$p$-value*, and *confidence interval*.
- Finally, @sec-sup-learning-regression will briefly discuss the connections between supervised learning and regression analysis regarding terminology.

Without further ado, let us start with reviewing core concepts in probability via quite a tasty example.

## Basics of Probability {#sec-basics-prob}

In terms of `r colourize("regression analysis", "blue")` and its `r colourize("supervised learning", "magenta")` counterpart (either on an **inferential** or **predictive** framework), `r colourize("probability", "blue")` can be viewed as the solid foundation on which more complex tools, including estimation and `r colourize("hypothesis testing", "blue")`, are built upon. Having said that, let us scaffold across all the necessary probabilistic concepts that will allow us to move forward into these more complex tools.

### First Insights {#sec-first-insights}

To start building up our solid probabilistic foundation, we assume our data is coming from a given `r colourize("population", "blue")` or system of interest. Moreover, the `r colourize("population", "blue")` or system is assumed to be governed by `r colourize("parameters", "blue")` which, as data scientists or researchers, they are of our best interest to study. That said, the terms `r colourize("population", "blue")` and `r colourize("parameter", "blue")` will pave the way to our first statistical definitions.

::: {#Definition-population .definition}
::::{.definition-header}
Definition of population
::::
::::{.definition-container}
It is a **whole collection of individuals or items** that share **distinctive attributes**. As data scientists or researchers, we are interested in studying these attributes, which we assume are **governed** by `r colourize("parameters", "blue")`. In practice, we must be **as specific as possible** when defining our given `r colourize("population", "blue")` such that we would frame our entire data modelling process since its very early stages. Examples of a `r colourize("population", "blue")` could be the following:

- *Children between the ages of 5 and 10 years old in states of the American West Coast.*
- *Customers of musical vinyl records in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta.*
- *Avocado trees grown in the Mexican state of MichoacÃ¡n.*
- *Adult giant pandas in the Southwestern Chinese province of Sichuan.*
- *Mature aÃ§aÃ­ palm trees from the Brazilian Amazonian jungle.*

![Image by [*Eak K.*](https://pixabay.com/users/eak_kkk-907811/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=1044891) via [*Pixabay*](https://pixabay.com/photos/lego-toys-figurines-crowd-many-1044891/).](img/lego.jpg){width="550"} 

Note that the term `r colourize("population", "blue")` could be exchanged for the term **system**, given that certain contexts do not particularly refer to individuals or items. Instead, these contexts could refer to **processes** whose attributes are also governed by `r colourize("parameters", "blue")`. Examples of a **system** could be the following:

- *The production of cellular phones from a given model in a set of manufacturing facilities.*
- *The sale process in the Vancouver franchises of a well-known ice cream parlour.*
- *The transit cycle during rush hours on weekdays in the twelve lines of Mexico City's subway.*

Definition of parameter
::::
::::{.definition-container}
It is a characteristic (**numerical** or even **non-numerical**, such as a **distinctive category**) that **summarizes** the state of our `r colourize("population", "blue")` or **system** of interest. Examples of a `r colourize("population parameter", "blue")` can be described as follows:

- *The average weight of children between the ages of 5 and 10 years old in states of the American west coast (**numerical**).*
- *The variability in the height of the mature aÃ§aÃ­ palm trees from the Brazilian Amazonian jungle (**numerical**).*
- *The proportion of defective items in the production of cellular phones in a set of manufacturing facilities (**numerical**).*
- *The average customer waiting time to get their order in the Vancouver franchises of a well-known ice cream parlour (**numerical**).*
- *The most favourite pizza topping of vegetarian adults between the ages of 30 and 40 years old in Edmonton (**non-numerical**).*

Note the **standard mathematical notation** for `r colourize("population parameters", "blue")` are **Greek letters** (for more insights, you can check @sec-greek-alphabet). Moreover, in practice, these `r colourize("population parameter(s)", "blue")` of interest will be **unknown** to the data scientist or researcher. Instead, they would use formal statistical inference to **estimate** them.
::::
:::

The `r colourize("parameter", "blue")` [definition](#Definition-parameter) points out a crucial fact in investigating any given `r colourize("population", "blue")` or system: 

> **Our `r colourize("parameter(s)", "blue")` of interest are usually *unknown*!** 

Given this fact, it would be pretty unfortunate and inconvenient if we eventually wanted to discover any significant insights about the `r colourize("population", "blue")` or system. Therefore, let us proceed to our so-called tasty example so we can dive into the need for statistical inference and why `r colourize("probability", "blue")` is our perfect ally in this `r colourize("parameter", "blue")` quest.

Imagine you are the owner of a large fleet of ice cream carts, around 900 to be exact. These ice cream carts operate across different parks in the following Canadian cities: *Vancouver*, *Victoria*, *Edmonton*, *Calgary*, *Winnipeg*, *Ottawa*, *Toronto*, and *MontrÃ©al*. In the past, to optimize operational costs, you decided to limit ice cream cones to only two items: *vanilla* and *chocolate* flavours, as in @fig-ice-cream.

::: {#fig-ice-cream}
![](img/ice-cream.jpg){width="390"}

:::

Now, let us direct this whole case onto a more statistical and probabilistic field; suppose you have a well-defined overall `r colourize("population", "blue")` of interest for those above eight Canadian cities: **children between 4 and 11 years old attending these parks during the Summer weekends**. Of course, Summer time is coming this year, and you would like to know **which ice cream cone flavour is the favourite one** for this `r colourize("population", "blue")` (*and by how much!*). As a business owner, investigating ice cream flavour preferences would allow you to plan Summer restocks more carefully with your corresponding suppliers. Therefore, it would be essential to start collecting consumer data so the company can tackle this **demand query**.

Also, suppose there is a second query. For the sake of our case, we will call it a **time query**. As a critical component of demand planning, besides estimating which cone flavour is the most preferred one (*and by how much!*) for the above `r colourize("population", "blue")` of interest, the operations area is currently requiring a realistic estimation of **the `r colourize("average", "blue")` waiting time from one customer to the next one in any given cart during Summer weekends**. This `r colourize("average", "blue")` waiting time would allow the operations team to plan carefully how much stock each cart should have so there will not be any waste or shortage.

![Image by [*Icons8 Team*](https://unsplash.com/@icons8?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash) via [*Unsplash*](https://unsplash.com/photos/silver-bell-alarm-clock-dhZtNlvNE8M).](img/clock.jpg){width="500"}

Note that the nature of the aforementioned **time query** is more related to a larger `r colourize("population", "blue")`. Therefore, we can define it as **all our ice cream customers during the Summer weekends**. Furthermore, this second definition would expand this query to our corresponding general ice cream customers, given the requirements of our operations team, and **not** all the children between 4 and 11 years old attending the parks during Summer weekends. Consequently, it is crucial to note that the nature of our queries will dictate how we define our `r colourize("population", "blue")` and our subsequent data modelling and statistical inference.

Summer time represents the most profitable season from a business perspective, thus solving these above two queries is a significant priority for your company. Hence, you decide to organize a meeting with your eight general managers (one per Canadian city). Finally, during the meeting with the general managers, it was decided to do the following:

1. For the **demand query**, a comprehensive market study will be run on the `r colourize("population", "blue")` of interest across the eight Canadian cities right before next Summer; suppose we are currently in Spring.
2. For the **time query**, since the operations team has not previously recorded any historical data (surprisingly!), **ALL** vendor staff from 900 carts will start collecting data on **the waiting time in seconds** between each customer this upcoming Summer.

When discussing study requirements for the marketing firm who would be in charge of it for the **demand query**, *Vancouver's general manager* dares to state the following:

> *Since we're already planning to collect consumer data on these cities, let's mimic a census-type study to ensure we can have the **MOST PRECISE** results on their preferences.*

On the other hand, when agreeing on the specific operations protocol to start recording waiting times for all the 900 vending carts this upcoming Summer, *Ottawa's general manager* provides a comment for further statistical food for thought:

> *The operations protocol for recording waiting times in the 900 vending carts looks too cumbersome to implement straightforwardly this upcoming Summer. Why don't we select **A SMALLER SET** of waiting times between two general customers across the 900 ice cream carts in the eight cities to have a more efficient process implementation that would allow us to optimize operational costs?*

Bingo! *Ottawa's general manager* just nailed the probabilistic way of making inference on our `r colourize("population parameter", "blue")` of interest for the **time query**. Indeed, their comment was primarily framed from a business perspective of optimizing operational costs. Still, this fact does not take away a crucial insight on which statistical inference is built: a `r colourize("random sample", "blue")` (as in its [corresponding definition](#Definition-random-sample)). As for *Vancouver's general manager*, ironically, their statement is **NOT PRECISE** at all! Mimicking a census-type study might not be the most optimal decision for the **demand query** given the time constraint and the potential size of its target `r colourize("population", "blue")`. 

> **Realistically, there is no cheap and efficient way to conduct a census-type study for any of the two queries!**

Moving on to one of the core topics in this chapter, we can state that `r colourize("probability", "blue")` is viewed as the language to decode random phenomena that occur in any given `r colourize("population", "blue")` or system of interest. In our example, we have two random phenomena:

1. For the **demand query**, a phenomenon can be represented by the preferred ice cream cone flavour of **any randomly selected child between 4 and 11 years old attending the parks of the above eight Canadian cities during the Summer weekends**. 
1. Regarding the **time query**, a phenomenon of this kind can be represented by **any randomly recorded waiting time between two customers during a Summer weekend in any of the above eight Canadian cities across the 900 ice cream carts**. 

Now, let us finally define what we mean by `r colourize("probability", "blue")` along with the inherent concept of `r colourize("sample space", "blue")`.

::: {#Definition-probability .definition}
::::{.definition-header}
Definition of probability
::::
::::{.definition-container}
Let $A$ be an event of interest in a random phenomenon of a `r colourize("population", "blue")` or **system** of interest, whose all possible outcomes belong to a given `r colourize("sample space", "blue")` $S$. Generally, the `r colourize("probability", "blue")` for this event $A$ happening can be mathematically depicted as $P(A)$. Moreover, **suppose we observe the random phenomenon $n$ times** such as we were running some class of experiment, then $P(A)$ is defined as the following ratio:

$$
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of times event $A$ is observed}}{n},
$${#eq-probability}

**as the $n$ times we observe the random phenomenon goes to infinity.**\

@eq-probability will always put $P(A)$ in the following numerical range:

$$
0 \leq P(A) \leq 1.
$$

Note each of these outcomes has a determined `r colourize("probability", "blue")` associated with them. If we add up all these `r colourize("probabilities", "blue")`, the `r colourize("probability", "blue")` of the `r colourize("sample space", "blue")` $S$ will be one, i.e.,

### Schools of Statistical Thinking {#sec-stats-schools}

Note the above [definition](#Definition-probability) for the `r colourize("probability", "blue")` of an event $A$ specifically highlights the following:

>**... as the $n$ times we observe the random phenomenon goes to infinity.**

The "*infinity*" term is key when it comes to understanding the philosophy behind the `r colourize("frequentist", "blue")` school of statistical thinking in contrast to its `r colourize("Bayesian", "blue")`  counterpart. In general, the `r colourize("frequentist", "blue")` way of practicing statistics in terms of `r colourize("probability", "blue")` and inference is the approach we usually learn in introductory courses, more specifically when it comes to **hypothesis testing** and `r colourize("confidence intervals", "blue")` which will be explored in @sec-basics-inf. That said, the `r colourize("Bayesian", "blue")` approach is another way of practicing statistical inference. Its philosophy differs in what information is used to infer our `r colourize("population parameters", "blue")` of interest. Below, we briefly define both schools of thinking.

::: {#Definition-frequentist-stats .definition}
::::{.definition-header}
Definition of frequentist statistics
::::
::::{.definition-container}
This statistical school of thinking heavily relies on the **frequency of events** to estimate specific `r colourize("parameters", "blue")` of interest in a `r colourize("population", "blue")` or **system**. This frequency of events is reflected in the repetition of $n$ experiments involving a random phenomenon within this `r colourize("population", "blue")` or **system**.\

Under the umbrella of this approach, we assume that our governing `r colourize("parameters", "blue")` are **fixed**. Note that, within the philosophy of this school of thinking, we can only make **precise** and **accurate** predictions as long as we repeat our $n$ experiments as many times as possible, i.e., 

$$
n \rightarrow \infty.
$$
::::
:::

::: {#Definition-bayesian-stats .definition}
::::{.definition-header}
Definition of Bayesian statistics
::::
::::{.definition-container}
This statistical school of thinking also relies on the **frequency of events** to estimate specific `r colourize("parameters", "blue")` of interest in a `r colourize("population", "blue")` or **system**.  Nevertheless, unlike `r colourize("frequentist", "blue")` statistics, `r colourize("Bayesian", "blue")` statisticians use **prior knowledge** on the `r colourize("population parameters", "blue")` to update their estimations on them along with the **current evidence** they can gather. This evidence is in the form of the repetition of $n$ experiments involving a random phenomenon. All these ingredients allow `r colourize("Bayesian", "blue")` statisticians to make inference by conducting  appropriate **hypothesis testings**, which are designed differently from their mainstream `r colourize("frequentist", "blue")` counterpart.

![The unique known portrait of Reverend Thomas Bayes according to @odonnell1936, even though @bellhouse2004 argues it might not be a Bayes' portrait.](img/thomas-bayes.jpg){width="300"}

Under the umbrella of this approach, we assume that our governing `r colourize("parameters", "blue")` are **random**; i.e., they have their own `r colourize("sample space", "blue")` and `r colourize("probabilities", "blue")` associated to their corresponding outcomes. The statistical process of inference is heavily backed up by **probability theory** mostly in the form of the **Bayes theorem** (named after Reverend **Thomas Bayes**, an English statistician from the 18th century). This theorem uses our **current evidence** along with our **prior beliefs** to deliver a **posterior distribution** of our **random** `r colourize("parameter(s)", "blue")` of interest.
::::
:::

Let us put the definitions for these two schools of statistical thinking into a more concrete example. We can use the **demand query** from our ice cream case as a starting point. More concretely, we can dig more into a standalone `r colourize("population parameter", "blue")` such as the `r colourize("probability", "blue")` that a randomly selected child between 4 and 11 years old, attending the parks of the above eight Canadian cities during the Summer weekends, prefers the chocolate-flavoured ice cream cone over the vanilla one. Think about the following two hypothetical questions:

a. From a `r colourize("frequentist", "blue")` point of view, what is the **estimated** `r colourize("probability", "blue")` of **preferring chocolate over vanilla** after **randomly** surveying $n = 100$ children from our `r colourize("population", "blue")` of interest?
b. Using a `r colourize("Bayesian", "blue")` approach, suppose the marketing team has found ten **prior** market studies on similar children `r colourize("populations", "blue")` on their preferred ice cream flavour (between chocolate and vanilla). Therefore, along with our actual **random** survey of $n = 100$ children from our `r colourize("population", "blue")` of interest, what is the **posterior estimation** of the `r colourize("probability", "blue")` of **preferring chocolate over vanilla**?

By comparing the above (a) and (b), we can see one characteristic in common when it comes to the estimation of the `r colourize("probability", "blue")` of **preferring chocolate over vanilla**: both `r colourize("frequentist", "blue")` and `r colourize("Bayesian", "blue")` approaches rely on the gathered **evidence** coming from the **random** survey of $n = 100$ children from our `r colourize("population", "blue")` of interest. On the one hand, the `r colourize("frequentist", "blue")` approach solely relies on **observed data** to **estimate** this single `r colourize("probability", "blue")` of **preferring chocolate over vanilla**. On the other hand, the `r colourize("Bayesian", "blue")` approach uses the **observed data** in conjunction with the **prior** knowledge provided by the ten estimated `r colourize("probabilities", "blue")` to deliver a whole posterior distribution (i.e., the **posterior estimation**) of the `r colourize("probability", "blue")` of **preferring chocolate over vanilla**.

::::{.Heads-up-container}
Even though most of us began our statistical journey in a `r colourize("frequentist", "blue")` framework, we might be tempted to state that a `r colourize("Bayesian", "blue")` paradigm for `r colourize("parameter", "blue")` estimation and inference is better than a `r colourize("frequentist", "blue")` one since the former only takes into account the **observed evidence** without the **prior knowledge** on our `r colourize("parameters", "blue")` of interest.

In the statistical community, there could be a fascinating debate between the **pros** and **cons** of each school of thinking. That said, **it is crucial to state that no paradigm is considered wrong!** Instead, using a **pragmatic strategy** of performing statistics according to our data science context is more convenient.

Tip on further Bayesian and frequentist insights!

::::{.Tip-container}
Let us check the following two examples (**aside from our ice cream case**) to illustrate the above pragmatic way of doing things:

1. Take the production of cellular phones from a given model in a set of manufacturing facilities as the context. Hence, one might find a `r colourize("frequentist", "blue")` estimation of the proportion of defective items as a quicker and more efficient way to correct any given manufacturing process. That is, we will sample products from our finalized batches and check their status (**defective** or **non-defective**, our **observed evidence**) to deliver a proportion estimation of defective items.
2. Now, take a physician's context. It would not make a lot of sense to study the `r colourize("probability", "blue")` that a patient develops a certain disease by only using a `r colourize("frequentist", "blue")` approach, i.e., looking at the current symptoms which account for the **observed evidence**. In lieu, a `r colourize("Bayesian", "blue")` approach would be more suitable to study this `r colourize("probability", "blue")` which uses the **observed evidence** combined with the patient's history (i.e., the **prior knowledge**) to deliver our **posterior belief** on the disease `r colourize("probability", "blue")`.
::::

Having said all this, it is important to reiterate that the focus of this textbook is **purely `r colourize("frequentist", "blue")`** in regards to data modelling in `r colourize("regression analysis", "blue")`. If you would like to explore the fundamentals of the `r colourize("Bayesian", "blue")` paradigm; @johnson2022 have developed an amazing textbook on the basic `r colourize("probability", "blue")` theory behind this school of statistical thinking along with a whole variety regression techniques including the `r colourize("parameter", "blue")` estimation rationale.

### The Random Variables {#sec-random-variables}

As we continue our `r colourize("frequentist", "blue")` quest to review the probabilistic insights related to `r colourize("parameter", "blue")` estimation and statistical inference, we will focus on our ice cream case while providing a comprehensive array of definitions. Many of these definitions are inspired by the work of @casella2024 and @soch2023. 

Each time we introduce a new probabilistic or statistical concept, we will apply it immediately to this ice cream case, allowing for hands-on practice that meets the learning objectives of this chapter. It is important to pay close attention to the **definition** and **heads-up** admonitions, as they are essential for fully understanding how these concepts apply to the ice cream case. On the other hand, the **tip** admonitions are designed to offer additional theoretical insights that may interest you, but they can be skipped if you prefer.

|       | **Demand Query** | **Time Query** |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| **Statement** | We would like to know **which** ice cream flavour is the favourite one (either **chocolate** or **vanilla**) and by **how much**. | We would like to know the **average** waiting time from one customer to the next one in any given ice cream cart. |
| **Population of interest** | **Children between 4 and 11 years old** attending different parks in Vancouver, Victoria, Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Toronto, and MontrÃ©al during Summer weekends. | **All our general customer-to-customer waiting times** in the different parks of Vancouver, Victoria, Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Toronto, and MontrÃ©al during Summer weekends across the 900 ice cream carts. |
| **Parameter**| **Proportion** of individuals from the population of interest **who prefer the chocolate flavour versus the vanilla flavour**. | **Average** waiting time from one customer to the next one. |

@tbl-queries-1 presents the general statements and `r colourize("populations", "blue")` of interest derived from our two queries: **demand** and **time**. It is important to note that these general statements are based on the storytelling we initiated in @sec-stats-schools. In practice, summarizing the overarching statistical problem is essential. This will enable us to translate the corresponding issue into a specific statement and `r colourize("population", "blue")`, from which we can define the `r colourize("parameters", "blue")` we aim to estimate later in our statistical process.

Now, recall that in our recent meeting with the general managers, *Ottawa's general manager* provided valuable statistical insights regarding the foundation of a `r colourize("random sample", "blue")`. For the **time query**, they suggested selecting a smaller set of waiting times between two general customers across the 900 ice cream carts. This process is known as **sampling**. 

Similarly, we can apply this concept to the **demand query** by selecting a subgroup of children aged 4 to 11 who are visiting different parks in these eight cities. Then, we can ask them about their favorite ice cream flavour, specifically whether they prefer **chocolate** or **vanilla**. It is important to note that we are not conducting any census-type studies; instead, we are carrying out two studies that heavily rely on sampling to estimate `r colourize("population parameters", "blue")`.

Furthermore, we want to ensure that our two groups of observationsâboth children and waiting timesâare representative of their respective `r colourize("populations", "blue")`. So, how can we achieve this? The **baseline** key is through what we call **simple random sampling**. This process involves the following per query:

1. For the **demand query**, let us assume there are $N_D$ observations in our `r colourize("population", "blue")` of interest. In a **simple random sampling scheme**, our `r colourize("random sample", "blue")` will consist of $n_D$ observations (noting that $n_D << N_D$), each having the same `r colourize("probability", "blue")` of being selected for our estimation and inferential purposes, which is given by $\frac{1}{N_D}$.
2. For the **time query**, assume there are $N_T$ observations in our `r colourize("population", "blue")` of interest. Again, in a **simple random sampling scheme**, our `r colourize("random sample", "blue")` will consist of $n_T$ observations (noting that $n_T << N_T$), each having the same `r colourize("probability", "blue")` of selection for estimation and inferential purposes, which is $\frac{1}{N_T}$. 

We can observe the concept of randomness reflected throughout the sampling schemes mentioned above. This aligns with what we referred to as **random phenomena** in both queries back in @sec-first-insights. Consequently, there should be a way to mathematically represent these phenomena, and the `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` is the starting point in this process.

A `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` is a function where the input values correspond to real numbers assigned to events belonging to the `r colourize("sample space", "blue")` $S$, and whose outcome is one of these real numbers after executing a given random experiment. For instance, a `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` (and its support, i.e., real numbers) is depicted with an uppercase such that 

$$Y \in \mathbb{R}.$$
::::
:::

To begin experimenting with `r colourize("random variables", "blue")` in this ice cream case, we need to define them clearly. It is important to be as clear as possible when defining `r colourize("random variables", "blue")`, and we should also remember to use uppercase letters as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
D_i &= \text{A favourite ice cream flavour of a randomly surveyed $i$th child} \\
& \qquad \text{between 4 and 11 years old attending the parks of} \\
& \qquad \text{Vancouver, Victoria, Edmonton, Calgary,} \\
& \qquad \text{Winnipeg, Ottawa, Toronto, and MontrÃ©al} \\ 
& \qquad \text{during the Summer weekends} \\
& \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \text{for $i = 1, \dots, n_D.$}  \\
\\
T_j &= \text{A randomly recorded $j$th waiting time in minutes between two} \\
& \qquad \text{customers during a Summer weekend in any of the above} \\
& \qquad \text{eight Canadian cities across the 900 ice cream carts} \\
& \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \text{for $j = 1, \dots, n_T.$}  \\
\end{align*}
$$

It is important to note that the **demand query** corresponds to the $i$th `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` $D_i$, where the subindex $i$ ranges from $1$ to $n_D$. The term $n_D$ represents the **size of our sample** for this query and theoretically indicates the number of `r colourize("random variables", "blue")` we intend to observe from our `r colourize("population", "blue")` of interest during our experiment. On the other hand, for the **time query**, we have the $j$th `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` $T_j$, with the subindex $j$ ranging from $1$ to $n_T$. In the context of this query, $n_T$ denotes the **size of our respective sample** and indicates how many `r colourize("random variables", "blue")` we plan to observe from our `r colourize("population", "blue")` of interest as part of our experiment.

Now, $D_i$ will require real numbers that correspond to potential outcomes derived from the specific **demand sample space** of ice cream flavor demand, which we can denote as $S_D$. It is crucial to note that a given child from our `r colourize("population", "blue")` may prefer a flavor other than chocolate or vanillaâfor example, strawberry, salted caramel, or pistachio. However, we are limited by our available flavor menu as a company. Therefore, we will restrict our survey question regarding these potential $n_D$ surveyed children as follows:

$$
d_i = 
\begin{cases}
1 \qquad \text{The surveyed child prefers chocolate.}\\
0 \qquad \text{Otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$${#eq-random-variable-demand}

In the modeling associated with @eq-random-variable-demand, an **observed `r colourize("random variable", "blue")`** $d_i$ **(thus, the lowercase)** can only yield values of $1$ if the surveyed child prefers chocolate and $0$ *otherwise*. The term â*otherwise*â refers to any flavor other than chocolate, which, in our limited menu context, is vanilla!

To define the real numbers from a given **waiting time sample space** $S_T$, associated with an **observed `r colourize("random variable", "blue")`** $t_j$ **(thus, the lowercase)** measured in minutes, we need to establish a possible range for these waiting times. It would not make sense to have observed negative waiting times in this ice cream scenario; therefore, our lower bound for this range of potential values should be $0$. However, we cannot set an upper limit on these waiting times since any ice cream vendor might need to wait for $1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10, \ldots, 20, \ldots, 60, \ldots$ minutes for the next customer to arrive. In fact, it is possible to wait for a very long time, especially on a low sales day! Thus, the range of this observed `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` can be expressed as:

$$
t_j \in [0, \infty),
$$

where the $\infty$ symbol indicates **no upper bound**.

After defining the possible values for our two random variables $D_i$ and $T_j$, we will now classify them correctly using probabilistic definitions as shown below.

::: {#Definition-discrete-random-variables .definition}
::::{.definition-header}
Definition of discrete random variable
::::
::::{.definition-container}
Let $Y$ be a `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` whose support is $\mathcal{Y}$. If this support $\mathcal{Y}$ corresponds to a finite set or a countably infinite set of possible values, then $Y$ is considered a `r colourize("discrete random variable", "blue")`. 

For instance, we can encounter `r colourize("discrete random variables", "blue")` which could be classified as

- **binary** (i.e., a finite set of two possible values),
- **categorical** (either **nominal** or **ordinal**, which have a finite set of three or more possible values), or 
- **counts** (which might have a finite set or a countably infinite set of possible values as integers).

Note a `r colourize("continuous random variable", "blue")` could be 

- **completely unbounded** (i.e., its set of possible values goes from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ as in $-\infty < y < \infty$), 
- **positively unbounded** (i.e., its set of possible values goes from $0$ to $\infty$ as in $0 \leq y < \infty$), 
- **negatively unbounded** (i.e., its set of possible values goes from $-\infty$ to $0$ as in $-\infty < y \leq 0$), or
- **bounded** between two values $a$ and $b$ (i.e., its set of possible values goes from $a$ to $b$ as in $a \leq y \leq b$).

::::
:::

Therefore, we can classify our two `r colourize("random variables", "blue")` as follows:

- For the **demand query**, the support of $D_i$ (denoted as $\mathcal{D}$) is a countable finite set with two possible values: $d_i \in \{0, 1\}$, as noted by @eq-random-variable-demand. Therefore, $D_i$ is categorized as a **binary `r colourize("discrete random variable", "blue")`**.
- For the **time query**, the support of $T_j$ (denoted as $\mathcal{T}$) is positively unbounded. This results in an uncountably infinite set of values that $T_j$ can take, including (but not limited to!) $0, \dots, 0.01, \ldots, 0.02, \ldots, 0.00234, \ldots, 1, \ldots, 1.5576, \ldots$ minutes. Therefore, $T_j$ is classified as a **positively unbounded `r colourize("continuous random variable", "blue")`**.

So far, we have successfully translated our two statistical queries into proper `r colourize("random variables", "blue")`, along with clear definitions and classifications derived from our problem statements, as well as the `r colourize("populations", "blue")` of interest, as noted in @tbl-queries-1. However, we still need to find a way to implement our `r colourize("parameters", "blue")`. The upcoming section will allow us to do just that.

### The Wonders of Generative Modelling and Probability Distributions {#sec-wonders-random-variables}

Before exploring the wonders of `r colourize("generative models", "blue")`, let us introduce @tbl-queries-2, an extension of @tbl-queries-1 that now includes the elements discussed in @sec-random-variables.

|       | **Demand Query** | **Time Query** |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| **Statement** | We would like to know **which** ice cream flavour is the favourite one (either **chocolate** or **vanilla**) and by **how much**. | We would like to know the **average** waiting time from one customer to the next one in any given ice cream cart. |
| **Population of interest** | **Children between 4 and 11 years old** attending different parks in Vancouver, Victoria, Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Toronto, and MontrÃ©al during Summer weekends. | **All our general customer-to-customer waiting times** in the different parks of Vancouver, Victoria, Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Toronto, and MontrÃ©al during Summer weekends across the 900 ice cream carts. |
| **Parameter** | **Proportion** of individuals from the population of interest **who prefer the chocolate flavour versus the vanilla flavour**. | **Average** waiting time from one customer to the next one. |
| **Random variable** | $D_i$ for $i = 1, \dots, n_D$. | $T_j$ for $j = 1, \dots, n_T$. |
| **Random variable definition** | A favourite ice cream flavour of a randomly surveyed $i$th child between 4 and 11 years old attending the parks of Vancouver, Victoria, Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Toronto, and MontrÃ©al during the Summer weekends. | A randomly recorded $j$th waiting time in minutes between two customers during a Summer weekend across the 900 ice cream carts found in Vancouver, Victoria, Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Toronto, and MontrÃ©al. |
| **Random variable type** | Discrete and binary. | Continuous and positively unbounded. |
| **Random variable support** | $d_i \in \{ 0, 1\}$ as in @eq-random-variable-demand. | $t_j \in [0, \infty).$ |

Having summarized all our probabilistic elements in @tbl-queries-2, the `r colourize("parameters", "blue")` of interest must come into play for our data modelling game! Hence, the question is:

> **Is there any feasible way to do so via the the foundations of random variables?**

The answer lies in what we call a `r colourize("generative model", "blue")`, for which we have a whole toolbox corresponding to another important concept called `r colourize("probability distributions", "blue")`, as shown below.

::: {#Definition-generative-model .definition}
::::{.definition-header}
Definition of generative model
::::
::::{.definition-container}
Suppose you observe some data $y$ from a `r colourize("population", "blue")` or system of interest. Moreover, let us assume this `r colourize("population", "blue")` or system is governed by $k$ `r colourize("parameters", "blue")` contained in the following vector:

$$
\boldsymbol{\theta} = (\theta_1, \theta_2, \cdots, \theta_k)^T.
$$

If we state that our observed data $y$ follows certain `r colourize("probability distribution", "blue")` $\mathcal{D}(\cdot)$, then we will have a `r colourize("generative model", "blue")` $m$ such that

$$
m: y \sim \mathcal{D}(\boldsymbol{\theta}).
$$

When we set a `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` $Y$, we also set a new set of $v$ possible outcomes $\mathcal{Y} = \{ y_1, \dots, y_v\}$ coming from the `r colourize("sample space", "blue")` $S$. This new set of possible outcomes $\mathcal{Y}$ corresponds to the range of the `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` $Y$ (i.e., all the possible values that could be taken on once we execute a given random experiment involving $Y$). 

That said, let us suppose we have a `r colourize("sample space", "blue")` of $u$ elements defined as 

$$
S = \{ s_1, \dots, s_u \},
$$

where each one of these elements has a `r colourize("probability", "blue")` assigned via a function $P_S(\cdot)$ such that

$$
P(S) = \sum_{i = 1}^u P_S(s_i) = 1.
$$

which has to satisfy @eq-sample-space.

Then, the `r colourize("probability distribution", "blue")` of $Y$, i.e., $P_Y(\cdot)$ assigns a `r colourize("probability", "blue")` to each **observed value** $Y = y_j$ (with $j = 1, \dots, v$) if and only if the outcome of the random experiment belongs to the `r colourize("sample space", "blue")`, i.e., $s_i \in S$ (for $i = 1, \dots, u$) such that $Y(s_i) = y_j$:

$$
P_Y(Y = y_j) = P \left( \left\{ s_i \in S : Y(s_i) = y_j \right\} \right).
$$

Since we have two different queries, we will use two instances of `r colourize("generative models", "blue")`. It is worth noting that more complex modelling could refer to a single `r colourize("generative model", "blue")`. However, for the purposes of this review chapter, we will keep it simple with these two `r colourize("generative models", "blue")`. 

Now, let us introduce a specific notation for our discussion: the **Greek alphabet**. Greek letters are frequently used to statistically represent `r colourize("population parameters", "blue")` in **modelling setups**, **estimation**, and **statistical inference**. These letters will be quite useful for our `r colourize("parameters", "blue")` in this ice cream case!

In the early stages of learning statistical modelling, including concepts such as `r colourize("regression analysis", "blue")`, it is common to feel overwhelmed by unfamiliar letters and terminology. Whenever confusion arises in any of the main chapters of this book regarding these letters, we recommend referring to the Greek alphabet shared by @sec-greek-alphabet. It is important to note that `r colourize("frequentist", "blue")` statistical inference primarily uses lowercase letters. **With consistent practice over time, you will likely memorize most of this alphabet!**

Let us retake the row corresponding to `r colourize("parameters", "blue")` in @tbl-queries-2 and assign their corresponding Greek letters:

- For the **demand query**, we are interested in the `r colourize("parameter", "blue")` $\pi$, which represents the proportion of individuals from the children `r colourize("population", "blue")` who prefer the chocolate flavour over the vanilla flavour. It is crucial to note that a proportion is always bounded between $0$ and $1$, similar to how `r colourize("probabilities", "blue")` function! For instance, a proportion of $0.2$ would mean that $20\%$ of the children in our `r colourize("population", "blue")` prefer chocolate flavour over vanilla. This definition establishes our demand query `r colourize("parameter", "blue")` as follows:

$$
\pi \in [0, 1].
$$

::: {.Heads-up}
::::{.Heads-up-header}
Heads-up on the use of $\pi$!

::::{.Heads-up-container}
In this textbook, unless stated otherwise, the letter $\pi$ will denote a `r colourize("population parameter", "blue")` and not the mathematical constant $3.141592...$
::::
:::

- For the **time query**, we are interested in the `r colourize("parameter", "blue")` $\beta$, which represents the average waiting time in minutes from one customer to the next one in our `r colourize("population", "blue")` of interest. Unlike the above $\pi$ `r colourize("parameter", "blue")`, $\beta$ is only positively bounded given the definition of our random variable $T_j$. Therefore, this definition establishes our time query `r colourize("parameter", "blue")` as follows:

$$
\beta \in (0, \infty).
$$

Having defined our `r colourize("parameters", "blue")` of interest with proper lowercase Greek letters, it is time to declare our corresponding `r colourize("generative models", "blue")` on a general basis. For the **demand query**, there will be a single `r colourize("parameter", "blue")` called $\pi$, where the observed child $d_i$ will follow the model $m_D$ such that

$$
\begin{gather*}
m_D : d_i \sim \mathcal{D}_D(\pi) \\
\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \text{for $i = 1, \dots, n_D.$}
\end{gather*}
$$

Now, for the **time query**, there will also be a single `r colourize("parameter", "blue")` called $\beta$. Thus, the observed waiting time $t_j$ will follows the model $m_T$ such that

$$
\begin{gather*}
m_T : t_j \sim \mathcal{D}_T(\beta) \\
\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \text{for $j = 1, \dots, n_T.$}
\end{gather*}
$$

Nonetheless, we might wonder the following:

> **How can we determine the corresponding distributions $\mathcal{D}_D(\pi)$ and $\mathcal{D}_T(\beta)$?**

Of course the above [definition ](#Definition-probability-distribution) of a `r colourize("probability distribution", "blue")` will come in handy to resolve this question. That said, given that we have two types of `r colourize("random variables", "blue")` (`r colourize("discrete", "blue")` and `r colourize("continuous", "blue")`), it is necessary to introduce two specific types of `r colourize("probability", "blue")` functions: `r colourize("probability mass function (PMF)", "blue")` and `r colourize("probability density function (PDF)", "blue")`.

where, for all $y \notin \mathcal{Y}$, we have

Let $Y$ be a `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` whose support is $\mathcal{Y}$. In general, the `r colourize("expected  value", "blue")` or `r colourize("mean", "blue")` $\mathbb{E}(Y)$ of this `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` is defined as a **weighted** `r colourize("average", "blue")` according to its corresponding `r colourize("probability distribution", "blue")`. In other words, this `r colourize("measure of central tendency", "blue")` $\mathbb{E}(Y)$ aims to find the middle value of this `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` by weighting all its possible values in its support $\mathcal{Y}$ as dictated by its `r colourize("probability distribution", "blue")`.

Given the above definition, when $Y$ is a `r colourize("discrete random variable", "blue")` whose `r colourize("PMF", "blue")` is $P_Y(Y = y)$, then its `r colourize("expected  value", "blue")` is mathematically defined as

$$
\mathbb{E}(Y) = \sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} y \cdot P_Y(Y = y).

Let $Y$ be a `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` either `r colourize("discrete", "blue")` or `r colourize("continuous", "blue")`. Its `r colourize("cumulative distribution function (CDF)", "blue")` $F_Y(y)  : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow [0, 1]$ refers to the `r colourize("probability", "blue")` that $Y$ is less or equal than an observed value $y$:

$$
F_Y(y) = P(Y \leq y).
$${#eq-cdf}

Then, we have the following by type of  `r colourize("random variable", "blue")`:

- When $Y$ is `r colourize("discrete", "blue")`, whose support is $\mathcal{Y}$, suppose it has a `r colourize("PMF", "blue")` $P_Y(Y = y)$. Then, the `r colourize("CDF", "blue")` is mathematically represented as:

$$
F_Y(y) = \sum_{\substack{t \in \mathcal{Y} \\ t \leq y}} P_Y(Y = t).
$${#eq-cdf-discrete}

- When $Y$ is `r colourize("continuous", "blue")`, whose support is $\mathcal{Y}$, suppose it has a `r colourize("PDF", "blue")` $f_Y(y)$. Then, the `r colourize("CDF", "blue")` is mathematically represented as:

$$
F_Y(y) = \int_{-\infty}^y f_Y(t) \mathrm{d}t.
$${#eq-cdf-continuous}

Note that in @eq-cdf-discrete and @eq-cdf-continuous, we use the auxiliary variable $t$ since we do not compute the summation or integral over the observed $y$ given its role on either the `r colourize("PMF", "blue")` or `r colourize("PDF", "blue")`. Therefore, we use this auxiliary variable $t$.

Heads-up on the properties of the cumulative distribution function!
::::
::::{.Heads-up-container}
It is important to clarify that a **valid** `r colourize("CDF", "blue")` $F_Y(y)$ fulfils the following properties:

a. $F_Y(y)$ must **never** be a decreasing function.
b. Given that $F_Y(y)  : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow [0, 1]$, it must **never** evaluate to be $< 0$ or $> 1$. The output of a `r colourize("CDF", "blue")` is a **cumulative `r colourize("probability", "blue")`**, hence the previous bounds.
c. When $y \rightarrow -\infty$, if follows that $F_Y(y) \rightarrow 0$.
d. When $y \rightarrow \infty$, if follows that $F_Y(y) \rightarrow 1$.

Now, in the case of a `r colourize("CDF", "blue")` corresponding to a `r colourize("continuous random variable", "blue")` $Y$, there is an additional handy property that relates the `r colourize("CDF", "blue")` $F_Y(y)$ to the `r colourize("PDF", "blue")` $f_Y(y)$:

$$
f_Y(y) = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}y} F_Y(y).
$${#eq-cdf-to-pdf}

@eq-cdf-to-pdf indicates that the `r colourize("PDF", "blue")` of $Y$ can be obtained by taking the first derivative of the `r colourize("CDF", "blue")` with respect to $y$.

Tip on the Law of the Unconscious Statistician!
::::
::::{.Tip-container}
The **law of the unconscious statistician (LOTUS)** is a particular theorem in `r colourize("probability", "blue")` theory that allows us to compute a wide variety of `r colourize("expected  values", "blue")`. Let us properly define it for both `r colourize("discrete", "blue")` and `r colourize("continuous random variables", "blue")`.

::::: {#thm-LOTUS-theorem-discrete}
Let $Y$ be a `r colourize("discrete random variable", "blue")` whose support is $\mathcal{Y}$. The **LOTUS** indicates that the `r colourize("expected  value", "blue")` of a general function $g(Y)$ of this `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` $Y$ can be obtained via $g(Y)$ along with the corresponding `r colourize("PMF", "blue")` $P_Y(Y = y)$. Hence, the `r colourize("expected value", "blue")` of $g(Y)$ can be obtained as

$$
\mathbb{E}\left[ g(Y) \right] = \sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} g(y) \cdot P_Y(Y = y).
$${#eq-expected-value-discrete-function}

:::::: {.proof}
Let us explore the rationale provided by @soch2023. Thus, we will rename the general function $g(Y)$ as another `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` called $Z$ such that:

$$
Z = g(Y).
$${#eq-rv-transformation-to-z-discrete-LOTUS}

Note this function $g(Y)$ can take on equal values $g(y_1), g(y_2), \dots$ coming from different observed values $y_1, y_2, \dots$; for example, if 

$$
g(y) = y^2
$$ 

both 

$$
y_1 = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad y_2 = -2
$$

yield 

$$
g(y_1) = g(y_2) = 4.
$$

The above @eq-rv-transformation-to-z-discrete-LOTUS is formally called a **`r colourize("random variable", "blue")` transformation** from the general function of `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` $Y$, $g(Y)$, to a new `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` $Z$. Having said that, when we set up a transformation of this class, there will be a **support mapping** from this general function $g(Y)$ to $Z$. This will also yield a proper `r colourize("PMF", "blue")`, 

$$
P_Z(Z = z) : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow [0, 1] \quad \forall z \in \mathcal{Z},
$$ 

given that $g(Y)$ is a `r colourize("random variable", "blue")`-based function.

Therefore, using the `r colourize("expected value", "blue")` definition for a `r colourize("discrete random variable", "blue")` as in @eq-expected-value-discrete, we have the following for $Z$:

$$
\mathbb{E}(Z) = \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}} z \cdot P_Z(Z = z).
$${#eq-expected-discrete-Z-LOTUS}

Within the support $\mathcal{Z}$, suppose that $z_1, z_2, \dots$ are the possible **different** values of $Z$ corresponding to function $g(Y)$. Then, for the $i$th value $z_i$ in this correspondence, let $I_i$ be the collection of all $y_j$ such that 

$$
g(y_j) = z_i.
$${#eq-LOTUS-discrete-subset} 

Now, let us tweak a bit the above expression from @eq-expected-discrete-Z-LOTUS to include this setting:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}(Z) &= \sum_{z \in \mathcal{Z}} z \cdot P_Z(Z = z) \\
&= \sum_{i} z_i \cdot P_{g(Y)}(Z = z_i) \\
& \qquad \text{we subset the summation to all $z_i$ with $Z = g(Y)$}\\
&= \sum_{i} z_i \sum_{j \in I_i} P_Y(Y = y_j). \\
\end{align*}
$${#eq-LOTUS-discrete-subset-2}

The last line of @eq-LOTUS-discrete-subset-2 maps the `r colourize("probabilities", "blue")` associated to all $z_i$ in the corresponding `r colourize("PMF", "blue")` of $Z$, $P_Z(\cdot)$ via the function $g(Y)$, to the original `r colourize("PMF", "blue")` of $Y$, $P_Y(\cdot)$, **for all those $y_j$ contained in the collection $I_i$**. Given that certain values $z_i$ can be obtained with more than one value $y_j$, such as in the above example when $g(y) = y^2$ for $y_1 = 2$ and $y_2 = -2$, note we have a second summation of `r colourize("probabilities", "blue")` applied to the `r colourize("PMF", "blue")` of $Y$.

Moving along with @eq-LOTUS-discrete-subset-2 in conjunction with @eq-LOTUS-discrete-subset, we have that:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}(Z) &= \sum_{i} z_i \sum_{j \in I_i} P_Y(Y = y_j) \\
&= \sum_{i} \sum_{j \in I_i} z_i \cdot P_Y(Y = y_j) \\
&= \sum_{i} \sum_{j \in I_i} g(y_j) \cdot P_Y(Y = y_j).
\end{align*}
$${#eq-LOTUS-discrete-subset-3}

The double summation in @eq-LOTUS-discrete-subset-3 can be summarized into a single one, given neither of the factors on the right-hand side is subindexed by $i$. Furthermore, this standalone summation can be applied to all $y \in \mathcal{Y}$ while getting rid of the subindex $j$ in the factors on the right-hand side:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}(Z) &= \sum_{i} \sum_{j \in I_i} g(y_j) \cdot P_Y(Y = y_j) \\
&= \sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} g(y) \cdot P_Y(Y = y) \\
&= \mathbb{E}\left[ g(Y) \right].
\end{align*}
$$

Therefore, we have:

$$
\mathbb{E}\left[ g(Y) \right] = \sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} g(y) \cdot P_Y(Y = y). \quad \square
$$

::::: {#thm-LOTUS-theorem-continuous}
Let $Y$ be a `r colourize("continuous random variable", "blue")` whose support is $\mathcal{Y}$. The **LOTUS** indicates that the `r colourize("expected  value", "blue")` of a general function $g(Y)$ of this `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` $Y$ can be obtained via $g(Y)$ along with the corresponding `r colourize("PDF", "blue")` $f_Y(y)$. Thus, the `r colourize("expected value", "blue")` of $g(Y)$ can be obtained as

$$
\mathbb{E}\left[ g(Y) \right] = \int_{\mathcal{Y}} g(y) \cdot f_Y(y).
$${#eq-expected-value-continuous-function}

:::::: {.proof}
Let us explore the rationale provided by @soch2023. Hence, we will rename the general function $g(Y)$ as another `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` called $Z$ such that:

$$
Z = g(Y).
$${#eq-rv-transformation-to-z-continuous-LOTUS}

As in the `r colourize("discrete", "blue")` LOTUS proof, the above @eq-rv-transformation-to-z-continuous-LOTUS is formally called a **`r colourize("random variable", "blue")` transformation** from the general function of `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` $Y,$ $g(Y)$, to a new `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` $Z$. Therefore, when we set up a transformation of this class, there will be a **support mapping** from this general function $g(Y)$ to $Z$. This will also yield a proper `r colourize("PDF", "blue")`:

$$
f_Z(z) : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow [0, 1] \quad \forall z \in \mathcal{Z},
$$ 

given that $g(Y)$ is a `r colourize("random variable", "blue")`-based function.

Analogous to @eq-cdf, we will use the concept of the `r colourize("CDF", "blue")` for a `r colourize("continuous random variable", "blue")` $Z$:

$$
\begin{align*}
F_Z(z) &= P(Z \leq z) \\
&= P\left[g(Y) \leq z \right] \\
&= P\left[Y \leq g^{-1}(z) \right] \\
&= F_Y\left[ g^{-1}(z) \right].
\end{align*}
$${#eq-cdf-z}

A well-known Calculus result is the **inverse function theorem**. Assuming that 

$$
z = g(y)
$$ 

is an invertible and differentiable function, then the inverse 

$$
y = g^{-1}(z)
$${#eq-inverse-z} 

must be differentiable as in:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z} \left[ g^{-1}(z) \right] = \frac{1}{g' \left[ g^{-1}(z) \right]}.
$${#eq-inv-function-theorem}

Note that we differentiate @eq-inverse-z as follows:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z} y = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z} \left[ g^{-1}(z) \right].
$${#eq-derivative-inv-y}

Then, plugging @eq-derivative-inv-y into @eq-inv-function-theorem, we obtain:

$$
\begin{gather*}
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z} y = \frac{1}{g' \left[ g^{-1}(z) \right]} \\
\mathrm{d}y = \frac{1}{g' \left[ g^{-1}(z) \right]} \mathrm{d}z.
\end{gather*}
$${#eq-derivative-inv-y-2}

Analogous to @eq-cdf-to-pdf, we use the property that relates the `r colourize("CDF", "blue")` $F_Z(z)$ to the `r colourize("PDF", "blue")` $f_Z(z)$:

$$
f_Z(z) = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z} F_Z(z).
$$

Using @eq-cdf-z, we have:

$$
\begin{align*}
f_Z(z) &= \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z} F_Z(z) \\
&= \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z} F_Y\left[ g^{-1}(z) \right] \\
&= f_Y\left[ g^{-1}(z) \right] \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z} \left[ g^{-1}(z) \right].
\end{align*}
$$

Then, via @eq-inv-function-theorem, it follows that:

$$
f_Z(z) = f_Y\left[ g^{-1}(z) \right] \frac{1}{g' \left[ g^{-1}(z) \right]}.
$${#eq-pdf-continuous-Z-LOTUS}

Therefore, using the `r colourize("expected value", "blue")` definition for a `r colourize("continuous random variable", "blue")` as in @eq-expected-value-continuous, we have for $Z$ that

$$
\mathbb{E}(Z) = \int_{\mathcal{Z}} z \cdot f_Z(z) \mathrm{d}z,
$$

which yields via @eq-pdf-continuous-Z-LOTUS:

$$
\mathbb{E}(Z) = \int_{\mathcal{Z}} z \cdot f_Y \left[ g^{-1}(z) \right] \frac{1}{g' \left[ g^{-1}(z) \right]} \mathrm{d}z.
$$

Using @eq-inverse-z and @eq-derivative-inv-y-2, it follows that:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}(Z) &= \int_{\mathcal{Z}} z \cdot f_Y(y) \frac{1}{g' \left[ g^{-1}(z) \right]} \mathrm{d}z \\
&= \int_{\mathcal{Y}} g(y) \cdot f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y.
\end{align*}
$$

Note the last line in the above equation changes the integration limits to the support of $Y$, given all terms end up depending on $y$ on the right-hand side.

Finally, given the `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` transformation from @eq-rv-transformation-to-z-continuous-LOTUS, we have:

$$
\mathbb{E}\left[ g(X) \right] = \int_{\mathcal{Y}} g(y) \cdot f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y. \quad \square

Proving the equivalence of @eq-first-variance and @eq-second-variance, requires the introduction of some further properties of the `r colourize("expected value", "blue")` of a `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` while using the **LOTUS**. We will dig into the insights provided by @casella2024.

::::: {#thm-theorem-mean-properties}
Let $Y$ be a `r colourize("discrete", "blue")` or `r colourize("continuous random variable", "blue")`. Furthermore, let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be constants. Thus, **for any functions $g_1(y)$ and $g_2(x)$ whose `r colourize("means", "blue")` exist**, we have that:

$$
\mathbb{E}\left[ a g_1(Y) + b g_2(Y) + c \right] = a \mathbb{E}\left[ g_1(Y) \right] + b \mathbb{E}\left[ g_2(Y) \right] + c.
$${#eq-expected-value-properties}

Firstly, let us prove @eq-expected-value-properties for the `r colourize("discrete", "blue")` case.

:::::: {.proof}
Let $Y$ be a `r colourize("discrete random variable", "blue")` whose support is $\mathcal{Y}$ and `r colourize("PMF", "blue")` is $P_Y(Y = y)$. Let us apply the **LOTUS** as in @eq-expected-value-discrete-function:

$$
\mathbb{E}\left[ a g_1(Y) + b g_2(Y) + c \right] = \sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} \left[ a g_1(y) + b g_2(y) + c \right] \cdot P_Y(Y = y).
$$
We can distribute the summation across each addend as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}\left[ a g_1(Y) + b g_2(Y) + c \right] &= \sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} \left[ a g_1(y) \right] \cdot P_Y(Y = y) + \\
& \qquad \sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} \left[ b g_2(y) \right] \cdot P_Y(Y = y) + \\
& \qquad \sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} c \cdot P_Y(Y = y).
\end{align*}
$$

Let us take the constants out of the corresponding summations:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}\left[ a g_1(Y) + b g_2(Y) + c \right] &= a \sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} g_1(y) \cdot P_Y(Y = y) + \\
& \qquad b \sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} g_2(y) \cdot P_Y(Y = y) + \\
& \qquad c \underbrace{\sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} P_Y(Y = y)}_1 \\
&= a \underbrace{\sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} g_1(y) \cdot P_Y(Y = y)}_{\mathbb{E} \left[ g_1(Y) \right]} + \\
& \qquad b \underbrace{\sum_{y \in \mathcal{Y}} g_2(y) \cdot P_Y(Y = y)}_{\mathbb{E} \left[ g_2(Y) \right]} + c.
\end{align*}
$$

For the first and second addends on the right-hand side in the above equation, let us apply the **LOTUS** again:

$$
\mathbb{E}\left[ a g_1(Y) + b g_2(Y) + c \right] = a \mathbb{E} \left[ g_1(Y) \right] + b \mathbb{E} \left[ g_2(Y) \right] + c. \quad \square
$$
::::::

Secondly, let us prove @eq-expected-value-properties for the `r colourize("continuous", "blue")` case.

:::::: {.proof}
Let $Y$ be a `r colourize("continuous random variable", "blue")` whose support is $\mathcal{Y}$ and `r colourize("PDF", "blue")` is $f_Y(y)$. Let us apply the **LOTUS** as in @eq-expected-value-continuous-function:

$$
\mathbb{E}\left[ a g_1(Y) + b g_2(Y) + c \right] = \int_{\mathcal{Y}} \left[ a g_1 (y) + b g_2(y) + c \right] \cdot f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y.
$$

We distribute the integral on the right-hand side of the above equation:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}\left[ a g_1(Y) + b g_2(Y) + c \right] &= \int_{\mathcal{Y}} \left[ a g_1 (y) \right] \cdot f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y + \\
& \qquad \int_{\mathcal{Y}} \left[ b g_2(y) \right] \cdot f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y + \\
& \qquad \int_{\mathcal{Y}} c \cdot f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y.
\end{align*}
$$

Let us take the constants out of the corresponding integrals:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbb{E}\left[ a g_1(Y) + b g_2(Y) + c \right] &= a \int_{\mathcal{Y}} g_1 (y) \cdot f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y + \\
& \qquad b \int_{\mathcal{Y}} g_2(y) \cdot f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y + \\
& \qquad c \underbrace{\int_{\mathcal{Y}} f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y}_{1} \\
&= a \underbrace{\int_{\mathcal{Y}} g_1 (y) \cdot f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y}_{\mathbb{E} \left[ g_1(Y) \right]} + \\
& \qquad b \underbrace{\int_{\mathcal{Y}} g_2(y) \cdot f_Y(y) \mathrm{d}y}_{\mathbb{E} \left[ g_2(Y) \right]} + c.
\end{align*}
$$

For the first and second addends on the right-hand side in the above equation, let us apply the **LOTUS** again:

$$
\mathbb{E}\left[ a g_1(Y) + b g_2(Y) + c \right] = a \mathbb{E} \left[ g_1(Y) \right] + b \mathbb{E} \left[ g_2(Y) \right] + c. \quad \square
$$
::::::
:::::

Finally, after applying some algebraic rearrangements and the `r colourize("expected value", "blue")` properties shown in @eq-expected-value-properties, @eq-first-variance and @eq-second-variance are equivalent as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}

Definition of conditional probability

Suppose you have two events of interest, $A$ and $B$, in a random phenomenon of a `r colourize("population", "blue")` or **system** of interest. These two events belong to the  `r colourize("sample space", "blue")` $S$. Moreover, assume that the  `r colourize("probability", "blue")` of event $B$ is such that

$$
P(B) > 0,
$$

which is considered the **conditioning event**.

Hence, the `r colourize("conditional probability", "blue")` of event $A$ **given** event $B$ is defined as

$$
P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)},
$${#eq-conditional-probability}

where $P(A \cap B)$ is read as **the `r colourize("probability", "blue")` of the intersection of events $A$ and $B$**.

Tip on the rationale behind conditional probability!
::::
::::{.Tip-container}
We can delve into the rationale of @eq-conditional-probability by using a handy probabilistic concept called **cardinality**, which refers to the corresponding total number of possible outcomes in a random phenomenon belonging to any given event or `r colourize("sample space", "blue")`.

:::::: {.proof}
Let $|S|$ be the cardinality corresponding to the `r colourize("sample space", "blue")` in a random phenomenon. Hence, as in @eq-sample-space, we have that:

$$
P(S) = \frac{|S|}{|S|} = 1.
$$

Moreover, suppose that $A$ is the **primary event of interest** whose cardinality is represented by $|A|$. Alternatively to @eq-probability, the probability of $A$ can be represented as 

$$
P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|}.
$$

On the other hand, the cardinality of the **conditioning event** is

$$
P(B) = \frac{|B|}{|S|}.
$${#eq-prob-card-B}

Now, let $|A \cap B|$ be the cardinality of the intersection between events $A$ and $B$. Its probability can be represented as:

$$

$${#eq-prob-card-A-int-B}

Analogous to @eq-prob-card-B and @eq-prob-card-A-int-B, we can view the conditional probability $P(A | B)$ as an updated probability of the primary event $A$ restricted to the cardinality of the conditioning event $|B|$. This places $|A \cap B|$ in the numerator and $|B|$ in the denominator as follows:

$$
P(A | B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|B|}.
$${#eq-prob-card-cond-A-B}

Therefore, we can play around with @eq-prob-card-cond-A-B along with @eq-prob-card-B and @eq-prob-card-A-int-B as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
P(A \cap B) &= \frac{|A \cap B|}{|B|} \\
&= \frac{\frac{|A \cap B}{|S|}}{\frac{|B|}{|S|}} \qquad \text{dividing numerator and denominator over $|S|$} \\
&= \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}. \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad \square

Suppose you have two events of interest, $A$ and $B$, in a random phenomenon of a `r colourize("population", "blue")` or **system** of interest. From @eq-conditional-probability, we can state the following expression for the `r colourize("conditional probability", "blue")` of $A$ **given** $B$:

$$
P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \quad \text{if $P(B) > 0$.}
$${#eq-cond-prob-A-given-B}

Note the `r colourize("conditional probability", "blue")` of $B$ **given** $A$ can be stated as:

$$
\begin{align*}
P(B | A) &= \frac{P(B \cap A)}{P(A)} \quad \text{if $P(A) > 0$} \\
&= \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)} \quad \text{since $P(B \cap A) = P(A \cap B)$.}
\end{align*}
$${#eq-cond-prob-B-given-A}

Then, we can manipulate @eq-cond-prob-B-given-A as follows:

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(B | A) \times P(A).
$$

The above result can be plugged into @eq-cond-prob-A-given-B:

$$

P(A | B) &= \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \\

Suppose you have two events of interest, $A$ and $B$, in a random phenomenon of a `r colourize("population", "blue")` or **system** of interest. These two events are **statistically** `r colourize("independent", "blue")` if event $B$ does not affect event $A$ and vice versa. Therefore, the `r colourize("probability", "blue")` of their corresponding intersection is given by:

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B).
$${#eq-ind-A-B}

Let us expand the above definition to a `r colourize("random variable", "blue")` framework:

- Suppose you have a set of $n$ `r colourize("discrete random variables", "blue")` $Y_1, \dots, Y_n$ whose supports are $\mathcal{Y_1}, \dots, \mathcal{Y_n}$ with `r colourize("PMFs", "blue")` $P_{Y_1}(Y_1 = y_1), \dots, P_{Y_n}(Y_n = y_n)$ respectively. That said, the joint `r colourize("PMF", "blue")` of these $n$ `r colourize("random variables", "blue")` is the multiplication of their corresponding standalone `r colourize("PMFs", "blue")`:

$$
\begin{align*}

Tip on the rationale behind the rule of independent events!
::::
::::{.Tip-container}
We can delve into the rationale of @eq-ind-A-B by using the `r colourize("Bayes' rule", "blue")` from @eq-bayes-rule along with the basic `r colourize("conditional probability", "blue")` formula from @eq-conditional-probability.

:::::: {.proof}
Firstly, let us assume that a given event $B$ does not affect event $A$ which can be probabilistically represented as

$$
P(A | B) = P(A).
$${#eq-unconditional-prob-A-B}

If the statement in @eq-unconditional-prob-A-B holds, by using the `r colourize("Bayes' rule", "blue")` from @eq-bayes-rule, we have the following manipulation for the below `r colourize("conditional probability", "blue")` formula:

$$
\begin{align*}
P(B | A) &= \frac{P(B \cap A)}{P(A)} \\
&= \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)} \qquad \text{since $P(B \cap A) = P(A \cap B$)} \\
&= \frac{P(A | B) \times P(B)}{P(A)} \qquad \text{by the Bayes' rule} \\
&= \frac{P(A) \times P(B)}{P(A)} \qquad \text{since $P(A | B) = P(A)$} \\
&= P(B).
\end{align*}
$$

Then, again by using the `r colourize("Bayes' rule", "blue")`, we obtain $P(B \cap A)$ as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
P(B \cap A) &= P(B | A) \times P(A) \\
&= P(B) \times P(A) \qquad \text{since $P(B | A) = P(B)$.}
\end{align*}
$$

Finally, we have that:

$$
\begin{align*}
P(A \cap B) &= P(B \cap A) \\
&= P(B) \times P(A) \\
&= P(A) \times P(B). \qquad \square
\end{align*}
$$

A `r  colourize("random sample", "blue")` is a collection of `r colourize("random variables", "blue")` $Y_1, \dots, Y_n$ of size $n$ coming from a given `r colourize("population", "blue")` or system of interest. Note that **the most elementary definition** of a `r  colourize("random sample", "blue")` assumes that these $n$ `r colourize("random variables", "blue")` are mutually `r colourize("independent", "blue")` and **identically distributed** (which is abbreviated as *iid*). 

The fact that these $n$ `r colourize("random variables", "blue")` are identically distributed indicates that they have the same mathematical form for their corresponding `r colourize("PMFs", "blue")` or `r colourize("PDFs", "blue")`, depending on whether they are `r colourize("discrete", "blue")` or `r colourize("continuous", "blue")` respectively. Hence, under a `r colourize("generative modelling", "blue")` approach in a `r colourize("population", "blue")` or system of interest governed by $k$ `r colourize("parameters", "blue")` contained in the vector

$$
\boldsymbol{\theta} = (\theta_1, \theta_2, \cdots, \theta_k)^T,
$$

we can apply the *iid* property in an elementary `r colourize("random sample", "blue")` to obtain the following joint `r colourize("probability distributions", "blue")`:

- In the case of $n$ *iid* `r colourize("discrete random variables", "blue")` $Y_1, \dots, Y_n$ whose common standalone `r colourize("PMF", "blue")` is $P_Y(Y = y | \boldsymbol{\theta})$ with support $\mathcal{Y}$, the joint `r colourize("PMF", "blue")` is mathematically expressed as

$$
\begin{align*}
P_{Y_1, \dots, Y_n}(Y_1 = y_1, \dots, Y_n = y_n | \boldsymbol{\theta}) &= \prod_{i = 1}^n P_Y(Y = y_i | \boldsymbol{\theta}) \\
& \quad \text{for all} \\
& \quad \quad y_i \in \mathcal{Y}, i = 1, \dots, n.
\end{align*}
$${#eq-joint-PMF-iid-random-variables}

- In the case of $n$ *iid* `r colourize("continuous random variables", "blue")` $Y_1, \dots, Y_n$ whose common standalone `r colourize("PDF", "blue")` is $f_Y(y | \boldsymbol{\theta})$ with support $\mathcal{Y}$, the joint `r colourize("PDF", "blue")` is mathematically expressed as

$$
\begin{align*}

& \quad \quad y_i \in \mathcal{Y}, i = 1, \dots, n.

$${#eq-joint-PDF-iid-random-variables}


Unlike @eq-joint-PMF-ind-random-variables and @eq-joint-PDF-ind-random-variables, note that @eq-joint-PMF-iid-random-variables and @eq-joint-PDF-iid-random-variables **do not** indicate a subscript for $Y$ in the corresponding `r colourize("probability distributions", "blue")` since we have identically distributed `r colourize("random variables", "blue")`. Furthermore, the joint distributions are conditioned on the `r colourize("population parameter", "blue")` vector $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ which reflects our `r colourize("generative modelling", "blue")` approach.

Therefore, the `r colourize("test statistic", "blue")` will also be a random variable, whose **observed value** will describe how closely the `r colourize("probability distribution", "blue")` from which the `r colourize("random sample", "blue")` comes from matches the `r colourize("probability distribution", "blue")` of the `r colourize("null hypothesis", "blue")` $H_0$.

More specifically, once we have obtained the `r colourize("observed effect", "blue")` and `r colourize("standard error", "blue")` from our **observed** `r colourize("random sample", "blue")`, we can compute the corresponding **observed** `r colourize("test statistic", "blue")`. This `r colourize("test statistic", "blue")` computation will be placed on the corresponding $x$-axis of the `r colourize("probability distribution", "blue")` of $H_0$ so we can reject or fail to reject it accordingly.

![](img/inferential-conclusions.png){width="1000"}

*Inferential conclusions* substage from the classical-based hypothesis testing workflow in @fig-classical-hypothesis-testing-workflow. This substage is directly preceded by *rest flavour and components* and followed by the corresponding *delivery significance conclusion* within the *results* stage of the *data science workflow* as shown in @fig-ds-workflow-results-2.

::::{.definition-container}
The `r colourize("critical value", "blue")` of a hypothesis testing defines the region for which we might reject $H_0$ in favour of $H_1$. This `r colourize("critical value", "blue")` is in the function of the `r colourize("significance level", "blue")` $\alpha$ and **test flavour**. It is located on the corresponding $x$-axis of the `r colourize("probability distribution", "blue")` of $H_0$. Hence, this value acts as a threshold to decide either of the following:

- If the **observed** `r colourize("test statistic", "blue")` exceeds a given `r colourize("critical value", "blue")`, then we have enough statistical evidence to reject $H_0$ in favour of $H_1$. 
- If the **observed** `r colourize("test statistic", "blue")` does not exceed a given `r colourize("critical value", "blue")`, then we have enough statistical evidence to fail to reject $H_0$.

Definition of $p$-value 
::::
::::{.definition-container}
A `r colourize("$p$-value", "blue")` refers to the `r colourize("probability", "blue")` of obtaining a `r colourize("test statistic", "blue")` just as **extreme** or **more extreme** than the **observed** `r colourize("test statistic", "blue")` coming from our **observed** `r colourize("random sample", "blue")` of size $n$. This `r colourize("$p$-value", "blue")` is obtained via the `r colourize("probability distribution", "blue")` of $H_0$ and the **observed** `r colourize("test statistic", "blue")`.

Alternatively to a `r colourize("critical value", "blue")`, we can reject or fail to reject the `r colourize("null hypothesis", "blue")` $H_0$ using this `r colourize("$p$-value", "blue")` as follows:

- If the `r colourize("$p$-value", "blue")` associated to the **observed** `r colourize("test statistic", "blue")` exceeds a given significance level $\alpha$, then we have enough statistical evidence to reject $H_0$ in favour of $H_1$. 
- If the `r colourize("$p$-value", "blue")` associated to the **observed** `r colourize("test statistic", "blue")` does not exceed a given significance level $\alpha$, then we have enough statistical evidence to fail to reject $H_0$.

Definition of confidence interval

::::{.definition-container}
A `r colourize("confidence interval", "blue")` provides an estimated range of values within which the true `r colourize("population parameter", "blue")` is likely to fall, based on the sample data. It reflects the degree of uncertainty associated with the obtained `r colourize("estimate", "blue")`. For instance, a 95% `r colourize("confidence interval", "blue")` means that if the study were repeated many times using different `r colourize("random samples", "blue")` from the same `r colourize("population", "blue")` or **system** of interest, approximately 95% of the resulting intervals would contain the true `r colourize("parameter", "blue")`.
